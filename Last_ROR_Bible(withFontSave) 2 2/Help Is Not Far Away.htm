<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>K</b></font>ing Jehoshaphat was at a
crossroads. His kingdom was
surrounded by a powerful army and
total destruction was imminent. With
many questions in his heart, he
turned to God for help. The problem
was far beyond human solution; he
needed God desperately and that
was Who he turned to.
&quot;Are you not the God in charge of
the universe? Is there
anything you can't do?&quot;
could probably summarize
the questions Jehoshaphat
must have asked. I want
you to understand here
that he wasn't in anyway
doubting God's ability to
save his kingdom. If he
was then he wouldn't
have decided to pray in
the first place. These
were rhetorical questions
and he didn't need any
answers, for he already
had the answers. He
recognized God as his
tower of refuge, and God
del ivered him and
preserved his kingdom by a mighty
hand.
Are you in a similar situation
today, where you desperately need
the miraculous intervention of
Almighty God? Are you facing a
challenge that only God can solve? I
want you to know that help is not
far away. Your boss, husband or
teacher may not be able to solve<em><strong> </strong></em>your problems, but I
know One person Who
can handle anything. He's
the God of all flesh and
there's nothing too
difficult for Him (Jeremiah
32:27).
<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;And Jehoshaphat
stood in the
congregation of
Judah and Jerusalem,
in the house of the
LORD, before the
new court, And said,
O LORD God of our
fathers, art not thou
God in heaven? ...Art
not thou our God,
who didst drive out
the inhabitants of this
land before thy people
Israel, and gavest it to
the seed of Abraham
thy friend for ever?&quot; (2 Chronicles 20:5-7).</strong></em><br>
<br>
It doesn't matter
how grave the situation
you're in today is, or
how dire your needs
are, the Lord is strong
enough to cause a
change. He's your refuge
and strength, your very
present help in times of
need (Proverbs 18:10).
