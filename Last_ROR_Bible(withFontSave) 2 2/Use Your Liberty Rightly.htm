<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>USE YOUR LIBERTY RIGHTLY</b></font></p>


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">W</font>hen you were born again,
you were born into a life
of absolute liberty in Christ. You
became free to live, free to serve
God, free to reign and free to love.
However, as Christians, the Bible
admonishes that we use our liberty
in Christ rightly. Under the Old
Testament, it was easy to read the
commandments so as to know what
to do and what not to do, but the
new creation man wasn't given any
law to obey (1 Timothy 1:9).
According to the Bible, it's difficult
to impute sin where there is no law
(Romans 4:15). Some Christians are in
a dilemma because they have been
brought into a life without
laws as it seems, and so
they use that as an
excuse to act uncircumspectly.
The life you live as a
child of God should be
to His praise and glory in
all things. Though it is
absolutely clear that God
has called you to a free
life, only make sure that
you don't use this freedom as an
excuse to do whatever you want to
do and as a result, destroy your
freedom. Rather, use your freedom
to serve others in love; that's how
freedom grows.
Use your liberty in Christ rightly
by doing only those things that
please the Father; and the way to
please the Father is walking by faith,
which by extension is walking
according to the provisions of God's
Word. Yes, God isn't imposing rules
and regulations on you, but make
up your mind to get into His Word
and do what the Word says. It's a
choice you have to make.

  <em><strong>&quot;For, brethren,
ye have been called
unto liberty; only
use not liberty for an
occasion to the flesh,
but by love serve one
another&quot; (Galatians 5:13).</strong></em><br>
<br>
 God has brought us
into a life of absolute
liberty and He'll never
force anything on us, but
be sure to use your
liberty to the praise and
glory of His Name.</p>
