YOU TO BE AN EFFECTIVE WITNESS <br>
FOR CHRIST</b></font></p>


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">A</font>s God's people, we've been
commissioned to preach the
gospel and show forth the kingdomlife
to the world. However, some
people aren't functioning effectively
in the ministry of reconciliation; they're
not fervent soul winners! Such people
allow opportunities to preach the
gospel pass them by unutilized. They
are those who make such comments
as, &quot;I feel shy whenever I want to
preach to others.&quot; Well, not when you
have the Holy Ghost, and definitely
not when you make a habit of speaking
in other tongues!
One of the many benefits of
speaking in tongues consistently is
that it emboldens you to
be an effective witness
for Jesus Christ. I once
heard a nine-year old boy
testify, &quot;I couldn't preach
the Word of God to my
classmates at school, but
when I received the Holy
Spirit and started speaking
in tongues, I became bold.
Then, each time I went
to school, I preached to
all my mates.&quot;
The Apos t le Paul , a per fect
example of an effective soul winner,
gave us an inspiring insight to his
success in missionary and evangelical
work when he said,<em> &quot;...from Jerusalem,
and round about unto Illyricum, I have
fully preached the gospel of Christ&quot;</em> (Romans 15:19). The man was confident
to state that he had fully
preached the gospel from Jerusalem
to Illyricum! <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;But ye shall receive
power, after that the
Holy Ghost is come
upon you: and ye
shall be witnesses
unto me both in
Jerusalem, and in
all Judaea, and in
Samaria, and unto the
uttermost part of the
earth&quot; (Acts 1:8).</em></strong><br>
<br>
He knew he had left no
stone unturned; that's what it means
to be an effective witness for Christ.
But what was Paul's secret?
Paul lets us in on one of the
secrets that stood him out as an<em><strong> </strong></em>effective witness of Christ
in 1 Corinthians 14:18,
meaning he was a man
who spoke in tongues
very often and very
intently, and that was key
to his success in ministry.
Practise speaking in other
tongues always; it will
energize your spirit to
do the work of God.</p>
