<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>YOU'RE SEPERATED<br>UNTO THE LORD</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>O</b></font>nce, when the children of
Israel disobeyed the Lord,
He said to them: <em>&quot;Therefore will I
number you to the sword, and ye shall
all bow down to the slaughter: because
when I called, ye did not answer...&quot;
(Isaiah 65:12).</em> Because of their
actions, their names were written
against the swords of their enemies,
thus condemning them to destruction.
Yet, at the time, not everyone in Israel
was numbered to the sword, for the
Lord in His mercy also declared that a
remnant shall be saved (2 Kings 19:31,
Ezra 9:8, Ezekiel 6:8).
This illustration parallels what
exist today: <em>&quot;Even so then at this
present time also there is
a remnant according to the
election of grace&quot; (Romans
11:5).</em> The world was
condemned in the beginning
because of Adam's
transgression, but God,
out of His great love for
man-kind, gave His Son
Jesus that He may purchase
and purify unto Himself a
peculiar people, holy and
consecrated to Him.
John 3:16 says, <em>&quot;For God so
loved the world, that he gave his only
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
in him should not perish&quot;... </em>In other
words, those who believe in Jesus
and accept Him as Lord of their lives
are the remnants the Lord has
chosen out of the condemned
world; they're the ones He has
separated to Himself.
Thus, not only has the Lord
separated you from the world unto
Himself, He has also promulgated a
decree that ensures you're not
numbered among those in the world
that would perish. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;For thou art an
holy people unto
the LORD thy God,
and the LORD hath
chosen thee to be a
peculiar people unto
himself, above all
the nations that are
upon the earth&quot; (Deuteronomy 14:2).</em></strong><br>
<br>
John 3:16 is not a<em><strong> </strong></em>promise, but a legal and
binding declaration: Anyone
who believes in Jesus
is sanctified unto the
Lord and separated from
destruction.
You were chosen by
the Lord before the
foundation of the world
to be separated and
sanctified unto Him.</p>
