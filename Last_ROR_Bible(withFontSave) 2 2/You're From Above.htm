<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he most sublime and profound
communication ever to proceed
from anyone came from the lips of
Jesus. The Jews in His day couldn't
comprehend the wisdom and audacity
with which He spoke. That's because
Jesus communicated with a spiritual
language, while they were men and
women of the senses. For example,
when He said in John 8:23, &quot;...I am
from above,&quot; He wasn't referring to a
physical life. He was referring to a
spiritual life!
Jesus knew that His life didn't come
from Mary, because He was the Word
of God made flesh. Conscious of that
reality, He could say with boldness
that He was not of this
world. Now, the Bible says
concerning us that as He
(Jesus) is, so are we in
this world (1 John 4:17). If
you're born again, you're
no longer an ordinary
person; you're from above
just as Jesus, and you
have the same indestructible
life that He has.
You've been born again of that
same living Word that came from
heaven (1 Peter 1:23), which means
you too can declare like Jesus, &quot;I am
from above!&quot; I would to God
every believer in Christ will live
with this consciousness. It will
change everything about you and
bring a supernatural perspective to
your life! Don't think like the rest of
the world; yes, you may look like
them physically, but the life in you is
from above.
Train yourself in this consciousness.
Speak a different language-the
language of the Kingdom that you're
from. <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;And he said unto
them, Ye are from
beneath; I am from
above: ye are of this
world; I am not of this
world&quot; (John 8:23).</strong></em><br>
<br>
Refuse to speak sickness,

disease, lack, and failure.
They're not part of your
heavenly Kingdom.
I encourage you to
carry this consciousness
to work, school, and
wherever you go.</p>
