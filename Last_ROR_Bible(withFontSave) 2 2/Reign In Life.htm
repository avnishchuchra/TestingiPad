<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>REIGN IN LIFE</b></font></p>
<p class="articles"><font size="+3">I</font>n Romans 5:17, the Apostle
Paul didn't say, &quot;...they which
receive grace&quot;; rather, he said, &quot;they
which receive abundance (the overflowing)
of grace.&quot; The word &quot;abundance&quot;
or &quot;overflowing&quot; brings to mind
a bowl filled to the brim and running
over. Paul talks about an overflowing
of grace that belongs only to those
who can receive it, and then he lets
us know that this grace is what you
need to reign in life.
So the question is, have you
received abundance of grace? Remember,
it's those who receive that
will reign in life, not those who are
given. Most people interpret the
word &quot;receive&quot; with some
passive connotation; they
think of it as that which
comes to you without
any effort on your part,
such as receiving a letter
in your mailbox. However,
the idea God's Word
brings to us suggests
something different. The
word &quot;receive&quot; is from the
Greek word &quot;lambano,&quot;
which doesn't suggest passive
receiving, but means to &quot;take&quot; or
&quot;catch&quot; something and make it yours;
to get hold of something; to seize
it.
When the woman with the issue
of blood touched Jesus' garment
and received her healing, she took
the power out of Him (Mark 5:29).
The Roman soldiers stripped Jesus
of those same garments and received
nothing because they didn't believe
(Matthew 27:35). So, it's not a
question of God's ability, but who
can receive. This is your set time to
reign in life; it's your season to
manifest the glory of God everywhere<em><strong> </strong></em>you go; therefore receive
grace for reigning!
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;For if by one man's
offence death reigned
by one; much more
they which receive
abundance of grace
and of the gift of
righteousness shall
reign in life by one,
Jesus Christ&quot;
(Romans 5:17).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
Take advantage of
the grace of God, for that
grace has been lavishly
poured out upon all men
(Titus 2:11); it's yours for
the taking! What is that
good thing you desire in
life, for which you require
grace? Seize it and make
it yours!</p>
