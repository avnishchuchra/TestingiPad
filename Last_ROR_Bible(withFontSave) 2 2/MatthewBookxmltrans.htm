<div id="Matthew 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 19">s</a>to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 20">t</a>for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.  </div></br>

<div id="Matthew 1:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,  </div></br>

<div id="Matthew 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Matthew 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now when <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 25">a</a>Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 26">b</a>from the east to Jerusalem,  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 27">c</a>Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 28">d</a>his star in the east, and are come to worship him.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And when he had gathered all <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 29">e</a>the chief priests and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 30">f</a>scribes of the people together, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 31">g</a>he demanded of them where Christ should be born.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 32">h</a>And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 33">i</a>that shall rule my people Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.  </div></br>

<div id="Matthew 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 34">j</a>they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And being warned of God <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 35">k</a>in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 36">l</a>Out of Egypt have I called my son.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 37">m</a>Jeremy the prophet, saying,  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 38">n</a>into the parts of Galilee:  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 2:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And he came and dwelt in a city called <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 39">o</a>Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 40">p</a>which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.  </div></br>
<div id="Matthew 3" class="chapters" >Chapter 3</div>
<div id="Matthew 3:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 In those days came <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 41">a</a>John the Baptist, preaching <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 42">b</a>in the wilderness of Judaea  </div></br>

<div id="Matthew 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 44">d</a>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 45">e</a>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.  </div></br>

<div id="Matthew 3:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 52">l</a>O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:verseID=Matthew 53">m</a>the wrath to come?  </div></br>
