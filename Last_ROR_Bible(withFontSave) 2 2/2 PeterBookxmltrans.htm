<div id="2 Peter 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 1">a</a>like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 2">b</a>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 3">c</a>through the knowledge of him <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 4">d</a>that hath called us to glory and virtue:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 5">e</a>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 6">f</a>partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 7">g</a>knowledge;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 8">h</a>to brotherly kindness charity.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 9">i</a>nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 But he that lacketh these things <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 10">j</a>is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 11">k</a>purged from his old sins.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 12">l</a>to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Wherefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 13">m</a>I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 14">n</a>though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Yea, I think it meet, as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 15">o</a>long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 16">p</a>Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 17">q</a>our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 For we have not followed <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 18">r</a>cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 19">s</a>were eyewitnesses of his majesty.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 20">t</a>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 21">u</a>the holy mount.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 22">v</a>a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 23">w</a>the day star arise in your hearts:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Knowing this first, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 24">x</a>no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 25">y</a>the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 26">z</a>but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="2 Peter 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 But <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 27">a</a>there were false prophets also among the people, even as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 28">b</a>there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 29">c</a>denying the Lord <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 30">d</a>that bought them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 31">e</a>and bring upon themselves swift destruction.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 32">f</a>through covetousness shall they with feigned words <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 33">g</a>make merchandise of you: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 34">h</a>whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 For if God spared not <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 35">i</a>the angels <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 36">j</a>that sinned, but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 37">k</a>cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And spared not the old world, but saved <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 38">l</a>Noah the eighth person, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 39">m</a>a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 40">n</a>turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 41">o</a>making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 42">p</a>delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 (For that righteous man dwelling among them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 43">q</a>in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 44">r</a>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 But chiefly <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 45">s</a>them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 46">t</a>Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Whereas <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 47">u</a>angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 But these, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 48">v</a>as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 49">w</a>And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 50">x</a>to riot in the day time. <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 51">y</a>Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 52">z</a>they feast with you;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 53">a</a>an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 54">b</a>Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 55">c</a>These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 For when <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 56">d</a>they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 57">e</a>were clean escaped from them who live in error.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 While they promise them <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 58">f</a>liberty, they themselves are <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 59">g</a>the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 60">h</a>if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 61">i</a>it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 2:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 62">j</a>The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 3" class="chapters" >Chapter 3</div>
<div id="2 Peter 3:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 63">a</a>and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 64">b</a>Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,  </div></br>

<div id="2 Peter 3:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 66">d</a>by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 67">e</a>standing out of the water and in the water:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 3:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 68">f</a>Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 3:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 69">g</a>fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 3:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 70">h</a>a thousand years as one day.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 71">i</a>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 72">j</a>is longsuffering to us-ward, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 73">k</a>not willing that any should perish, but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 74">l</a>that all should come to repentance.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 3:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 But <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 75">m</a>the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 76">n</a>the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Peter 3:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 82">t</a>that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Peter 3:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And account that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Peter 83">u</a>the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;  </div></br>
