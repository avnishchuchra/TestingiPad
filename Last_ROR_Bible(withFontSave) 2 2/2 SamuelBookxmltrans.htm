<div id="2 Samuel 1" class="chapters" >Chapter 1</div>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 1">a</a>the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 2">b</a>a man came out of the camp from Saul <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 3">c</a>with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 4">d</a>mount Gilboa, behold, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 5">e</a>Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 So I stood upon him, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 6">f</a>slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Then David took hold on his clothes, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 7">g</a>rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And David said unto him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 8">h</a>How wast thou not <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 9">i</a>afraid to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 10">j</a>stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 11">k</a>David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And David said unto him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 12">l</a>Thy blood be upon thy head; for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 13">m</a>thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 14">n</a>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 15">o</a>in the book of Jasher.)  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 16">p</a>how are the mighty fallen!  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 17">q</a>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 18">r</a>the daughters of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 19">s</a>the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 Ye <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 20">t</a>mountains of Gilboa, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 21">u</a>let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 22">v</a>anointed with oil.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 23">w</a>the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 24">x</a>stronger than lions.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 25">y</a>thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 1:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 26">z</a>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And it came to pass after this, that David <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 27">a</a>enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 28">b</a>Hebron.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 So David went up thither, and his <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 29">c</a>two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 30">d</a>his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 31">e</a>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 32">f</a>the men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 33">g</a>Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 34">h</a>the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 But <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 35">i</a>Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Ish-bosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 36">j</a>the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 37">k</a>Gibeon.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 38">l</a>the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And there were <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 39">m</a>three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 40">n</a>as light of foot <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 41">o</a>as a wild roe.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 42">p</a>under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 And Joab said, As God liveth, unless <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 43">q</a>thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 2:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 3" class="chapters" >Chapter 3</div>
<div id="2 Samuel 3:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 44">a</a>unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 45">b</a>of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 46">c</a>Geshur;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And the fourth, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 47">d</a>Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 3:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 3:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 3:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 48">e</a>Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 49">f</a>gone in unto my father's concubine?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 3:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 50">g</a>a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 51">h</a>So do God to Abner, and more also, except, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 52">i</a>as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 3:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 53">j</a>from Dan even to Beer-sheba.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 3:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 3:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Samuel 13:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Samuel 13:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 13:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Samuel 13:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 13:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 13:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 Then the king arose, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 292">r</a>tare his garments, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 293">s</a>lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Samuel 14:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 310">k</a>the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 311">l</a>As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 312">m</a>the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 313">n</a>his banished.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 For we <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 314">o</a>must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 315">p</a>devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 316">q</a>as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 317">r</a>he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 318">s</a>ac-cording to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 So Joab arose <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 319">t</a>and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 320">u</a>not see my face.

<div id="2 Samuel 14:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 321">v</a>from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 322">w</a>unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 323">x</a>and saw not the king's face.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 14:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 So Joab came to the king, and told him and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 324">y</a>kissed Absalom.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Samuel 15:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 15:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 15:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Absalom said moreover, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 327">c</a>Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 15:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 15:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 328">d</a>so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 15:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And it came to pass <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 329">e</a>after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Samuel 15:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Samuel 15:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And there came a messenger to David, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 338">n</a>The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Samuel 16:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 374">g</a>man of Belial:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 The LORD hath <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 375">h</a>returned upon thee all <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 376">i</a>the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 377">j</a>dead dog <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 378">k</a>curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And the king said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 379">l</a>What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 380">m</a>the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 381">n</a>Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 382">o</a>my son, which <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 383">p</a>came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 384">q</a>requite me good for his cursing this day.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 385">r</a>Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 386">s</a>David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 387">t</a>why wentest thou not with thy friend?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And again, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 388">u</a>whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 389">v</a>concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 390">w</a>art abhorred of thy father: then shall <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 391">x</a>the hands of all that are with thee be strong.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 392">y</a>in the sight of all Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 16:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And the counsel of Ahith-ophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 393">z</a>both with David and with Absalom.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17" class="chapters" >Chapter 17</div>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And I will come upon him while he is <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 394">a</a>weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 395">b</a>smite the king only:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 396">c</a>a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 397">d</a>melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 398">e</a>from Dan even to Beer-sheba, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 399">f</a>as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 400">g</a>the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Samuel 17:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 406">m</a>in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 407">n</a>the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan?

<div id="2 Samuel 17:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 409">p</a>Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 410">q</a>his city, and put his household in order, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 411">r</a>hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 Then David came to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 412">s</a>Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 413">t</a>Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 17:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Samuel 18:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 419">b</a>But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 18:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Samuel 24:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 610">x</a>And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 611">y</a>the plague may be stayed from the people.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 24:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Samuel 612">z</a>behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Samuel 24:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king.
