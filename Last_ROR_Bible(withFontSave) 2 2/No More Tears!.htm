<b>PASTOR ANITA</b>

<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>NO MORE TEARS!</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Lord Jesus came to put an
end to your tears of sorrow
and regret. He suffered excruciating
pain and died a shameful death on
the cross as full penalty for your sins
and rose again to give you a victorious
life. The Bible says He knows what
you're going through (Hebrews 4:15).
He's given you His Word and His
Spirit to help you come through victoriously.
So no matter the situation
you're facing today, dry your tears,
for your victory is sure.
Isaiah 53:1-12 tells us how Jesus
bore our shame, took our pains upon
Himself, and gave us His glorious life.
When He said, It is finished (John
19:30), just before He
gave up the ghost on the
cross of Calvary, He was
saying in essence No
more tears; your pains
are over. He has turned
your supposed mourning
into dancing, glory to
God!
No wonder the Bible says Fear
not; for thou shalt not be ashamed:
neither be thou confounded; for
thou shalt not be put to shame: for
thou shalt forget the shame of thy
youth, and shalt not remember the
reproach of thy widowhood any
more (Isaiah 54:4). God doesn't
want you to talk about the shame
you once experienced. Don't remind
yourself about it because God has
started glorious things in your life
today.
Wake up to the reality of God's
Word. The storm is over! <br>
<br>
<em><strong> And I will rejoice
in Jerusalem, and joy
in my people: and the
voice of weeping shall
be no more heard in
her, nor the voice of
crying (Isaiah 65:19).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
So wipe
  your tears and take up the Sword of
  the Spirit, which is the Word of God,
  
  
  
  
  
  
  to put the enemy to
  flight, and effect the
  changes you desire in
  your life.</p>
