<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>oo many Christians labour under
the burden of condemnation
and this is one of the tools the devil
uses to keep them in bondage. He
knows that the problem of sin has
been dealt with, and so he uses the
weapon of sin consciousness. In
other words, he makes them &quot;feel&quot;
as though they're sinning even when
they're not. This feeling of inadequacy
makes such people believe they're
not qualified to do God's work or
receive His blessings.
But the Bible declares that there's
no condemnation to them which are
in Christ Jesus, who walk not according
to the senses. That means it
doesn't matter whether
you &quot;feel&quot; condemned,
what matters is what the
Word of God says. Understand
this: the issue of sin
has been dealt with once
and for all by the death
of Jesus Christ. Jesus completely
destroyed the hold
of sin over us, and that's
why the Bible says <em>&quot;sin shall not have
dominion over you: for ye are not
under law, but under grace&quot; </em>(Romans
6:14).
There's no need for anyone of
God's children to keep wearing the
heavy cloak of self-condemnation. If
by any chance you do something
wrong, you have the right to obtain
forgiveness: <em>&quot;If we confess our sins,
he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness&quot;</em> (1 John 1:9). After
that, you don't need to keep
condemning yourself over the same
matter. Above all, don't try to live up
to the expectations of others; rather,<strong><em> </em></strong> live up to the expectation
of the Word of God.
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;There is therefore
now no condemnation
to them which are
in Christ Jesus, who
walk not after the
flesh, but after the
Spirit&quot;(Romans 8:1)</em></strong>.<br>
<br> 
That way, you'll experience
the liberty that
comes from walking by
faith, and not by your
feelings. God no longer
condemns you, so don't
condemn yourself.</p>
