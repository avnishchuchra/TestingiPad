<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Bible teaches that there
are different kinds of prayer.
The prayer of agreement is one of
them. It involves two or more people
joining their faith together and
deciding to pray concerning anything
in particular that they desire. If, for
instance, you want to effect a positive
change in your job, family, health, or
anything at all, that's when to call up
someone who believes
with you in the faith to
pray in agreement with
you.
The prayer of agreement
is a most sure way
of praying and getting
results. But be sure to
follow the rules. Firstly,
the scripture says if any
two of you shall agree;
that means it must involve
two or more people.
Then it says as touching
anything that they shall ask; that
means you must be specific. In other
words, the parties involved in the
prayer must be clear as to the exact
request to make. Finally, you must
pray in faith and in line with the
Word.
Having done all that, you can
rest assured that your prayers would
be answered. The Bible says, <em>this is the confidence
that we have in him, that,
if we ask any thing
according to his will, he
heareth us&quot;</em> (1 John 5:14).<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;And Again I say unto
you, That if two of
you shall agree on
earth as touching any
thing that they shall
ask, it shall be done
for them of my Father
which is in heaven.
For where two or
three are gathered
together in my name,
there am I in the
midst of them&quot; (Matthew 18:19-20).</strong></em><br>
<br>
The next time you want
  to effect a change concerning
  any situation,
  follow the rules of the
  prayer of agreement; it's
  one of the sure ways of
  praying and get t ing
results.</p>
