<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>YOU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE IN YOU</b></font></p>
<p class="articles"><font size="+3">E</font>ternal life is not a promise in
the sweet by-and-by; it is a
present-hour reality for the one who
is born again! When you're born
again, the life of God completely
supplants the human life with which
you were born by your earthly parents.
That's why the Bible lets us know that
your new life did not come from your
earthly parents but from the eternal,
living Word of God, and it will last
forever (1 Peter 1:23). If you're born
again, you don't have the human life
and the life of God co-existing side
by side (as some people claim); the
only life you have is eternal life,
which is the life of God.
Eternal life is the Godkind
of life; it's the life
that He alone possessed
until Jesus came and
made it available to us.
The Bible says in John
5:26, <em>&quot;For as the Father
hath life in himself; so hath
he given to the Son to
have life in himself.&quot; </em>Then
1 John 5:11-12 says, <em>&quot;And
this is the record, that
God hath given to us eternal life, and
this life is in his Son. He that hath the
Son hath life; and he that hath not
the Son of God hath not life.&quot; </em>When
you received Christ, you received
the life and nature of God into your
spirit-you received Zoe, the Godlife.
That life isn't subject to sickness,
disease or infirmity. The things that
affect the human life cannot affect
Zoe. That's why it's impossible for
God to get sick or suffer defeat.
Now that you know you have the
same quality of life that God has,
you ought to dominate the circumstances
of your world.


  <strong>  <em><br>
  <br>
  &quot;These things have I
written unto you that
believe on the name of
the Son of God; that
ye may know that ye
have eternal life, and
that ye may believe on
the name of the Son
of God&quot; (1 John 5:13). </em></strong><br>
<br>
Yes, your physical
body may look the same
as it was before you
were born again, but
every ounce of human
life has been emptied
and replaced with eternal
life. What you must do
now is live with this
consciousness. Become
conscious of your divine
origin.</p>
