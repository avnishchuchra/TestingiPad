DIVINE VISITATIONS</b></font></p>
  

<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Scriptures contain several
accounts of men and women
who experienced divine visitations.
Sometimes it was a visit by an angel;
at other times it was the Lord Himself.
These visitations were always lifechanging,
destiny-altering experiences.
The Bible tells us about Abraham
who, on a certain day, sat in his tent
door in the heat of the day and saw
three men passing by. By faith, he
perceived they weren't ordinary men
and called out to them to stop over
for some refreshments (Genesis 18:1-5).
It turned out that one of the three
men was the Lord Himself, while the
other two were angels. But guess
what? It was during that
encounter that the Lord
told Abraham exactly when
Sarah would conceive
and give birth (Genesis
18:10).
When Jacob was at a
crossroads in his life, it
took a divine visitation
from the Lord for him to
experience his much
desired turnaround. He
was alone one day when an angel
came to him and wrestled with him
all night long (Genesis 32:24). At the
break of dawn, he realized the angel
wasn't an ordinary angel but the
Spirit of God Himself, and pleaded
with Him to bless him. That was the
day the Lord changed his name from
&quot;Jacob&quot; which meant &quot;usurper&quot; or
&quot;swindler&quot; to &quot;Israel,&quot; which means
&quot;a prince of power with God.&quot; That
divine visitation changed his destiny
and set him on the path of
greatness.
We're in the last days, and God
wants to visit you and touch your
life in a special way. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Be not forgetful to
entertain strangers:
for thereby some have
entertained angels
unawares&quot;
(Hebrews 13:2).</em></strong><br>
<br>
Divine visitations<em><strong> </strong></em>were not reserved only
  for people in the Old
  Testament. So you can
  also expect to be divinely
  visited by God. A divine
  encounter with the Lord
  will definitely change
your life forever.</p>
