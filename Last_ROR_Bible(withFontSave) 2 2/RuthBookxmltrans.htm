<div id="Ruth 1" class="chapters" >Chapter 1</div>
<div id="Ruth 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now it came to pass in the days when <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 1">a</a>the judges ruled, that there was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 2">b</a>a famine in the land. And a certain man of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 3">c</a>Beth-lehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 4">d</a>Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah. And they came <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 5">e</a>into the country of Moab, and continued there.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 6">f</a>visited his people in <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 7">g</a>giving them bread.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 8">h</a>Go, return each to her mother's house: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 9">i</a>the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 10">j</a>the dead, and with me.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 The LORD grant you that ye may find <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 11">k</a>rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 12">l</a>that they may be your husbands?  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 13">m</a>the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 14">n</a>clave unto her.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 15">o</a>her gods: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 16">p</a>return thou after thy sister in law.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And Ruth said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 17">q</a>Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 18">r</a>thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 19">s</a>the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 20">t</a>When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 21">u</a>all the city was moved about them, and they said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 22">v</a>Is this Naomi?  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 I went out full, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 23">w</a>and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 1:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 24">x</a>in the beginning of barley harvest.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Ruth 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And Naomi had a <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 25">a</a>kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 26">b</a>Boaz.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 27">c</a>glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And, behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 28">d</a>The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 29">e</a>that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hear-est thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Then she <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 30">f</a>fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 31">g</a>all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 32">h</a>The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 33">i</a>under whose wings thou art come to trust.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Then she said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 34">j</a>Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 35">k</a>though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 36">l</a>was sufficed, and left.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 37">m</a>that she had reserved after she was sufficed.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 38">n</a>take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 39">o</a>Blessed be he of the LORD, who <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 40">p</a>hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 41">q</a>one of our next kinsmen.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 2:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3" class="chapters" >Chapter 3</div>
<div id="Ruth 3:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 42">a</a>shall I not seek <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 43">b</a>rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And now is not Boaz of our kindred, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 44">c</a>with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Wash thyself therefore, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 45">d</a>and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 46">e</a>his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 47">f</a>spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 48">g</a>a near kinsman.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And he said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 49">h</a>Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 50">i</a>at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 51">j</a>a virtuous woman.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And now it is true that I am thy <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 52">k</a>near kinsman: howbeit <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 53">l</a>there is a kinsman nearer than I.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 54">m</a>perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 55">n</a>as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 56">o</a>Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 3:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Then said she, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 57">p</a>Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 4" class="chapters" >Chapter 4</div>
<div id="Ruth 4:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 58">a</a>the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 4:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And he took ten men of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 59">b</a>the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 4:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:  </div></br>
<div id="Ruth 4:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 60">c</a>Buy it <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 61">d</a>before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ruth 62">e</a>for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.  </div></br>
