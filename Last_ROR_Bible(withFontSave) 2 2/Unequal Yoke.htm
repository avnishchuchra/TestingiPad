<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>UNEQUAL YOKE</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>G</b></font>od forbade the children of
Israel marrying non-Jews.
This instruction is still the same even
in the New Testament! <em>&quot;Be ye not
unequally yoked together with
unbelievers...&quot; </em>(2 Corinthians 6:14).
Let me explain what an unequal yoke
means. Years ago, when farmers
used cattle-mounted ploughs to
cultivate their farmlands, two cows
could be burdened together to pull a
plough; this was known as an equal
yoke. But a cow and a horse being
yoked together would be called an
unequal yoke. This means that you (a
Christian) and an unbeliever, cannot
be yoked together because it would
be an unequal yoke.
No Christian should
marry a non-Christian.
You belong to God's
family and in this new
family, God forbids it.
God loves us and He
doesn't want us to fall
into error as Solomon did.
According to Nehemiah,
Solomon's disregard for
this commandment became
his undoing (Nehemiah 13:25-
26). In spite of the fact that God
loved Solomon, visited him twice
and blessed him with wisdom unlike
any other man, his strange wives
took him out of God's will. And the
same thing will happen to any
believer today in the same
situation.
Righteousness has no fellowship
with unrighteousness, nor light with
darkness. You may love God with
your heart like Solomon, but if you're
unequally yoked with an unbeliever,
you're already out of His will and
headed for trouble. Nevertheless, if
you were already married to a non-Christian before you
received Christ, you are
not condemned, for your
salvation would sanctify
your partner.

<em><strong>&quot;Now therefore give
not your daughters
unto their sons,
neither take their
daughters unto your
sons, ...&quot;
(Ezra 9:12).</strong></em>
