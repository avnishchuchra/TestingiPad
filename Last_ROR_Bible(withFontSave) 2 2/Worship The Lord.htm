<b>PASTOR CHRIS</b>

<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>WORSHIP THE LORD</b></font></p>
 

<p class="articles"><font size="+3">A</font>  young lady had been sick for
several years and had been
given up to die. In that state, sick and
in pains, she was carried to a crusade.
During the time of worship, she
joined in and had a wonderful time,
ignoring her pains. She looked away
from her pains and sickness unto God.
Suddenly, she noticed her hands that
hadn't moved for years were lifted
up. Then it dawned on her that she'd
been healed of her disease. Overwhelmed
with joy, she gave her
testimony in tears. Hallelujah!
If you desire a miracle in your
situation, then you have to take your
attention away from the challenge
you're facing and worship
the Lord. The Bible says
Jonah prayed to the Lord
out of the fish's belly
(Jonah 2:1). Right in the
midst of trouble, Jonah
prayed unto the Lord. He
forgot about his situation
and prayed. When you
study the content of his prayer you'll
discover it was all of worship and
thanksgiving (Jonah 2:9). As he
worshipped and thanked the Lord
from the fish's belly, <em>&quot;the Lord spake
unto the fish, and it vomited out
Jonah upon the dry land&quot; </em>(Jonah
2:10). What a mighty deliverance!
Solutions come when you worship
the Lord in the midst of your trouble.
The Lord Jesus didn't respond to the
woman whose daughter was vexed
with an evil spirit until she worshipped
Him (Matthew 15:22-28).
Someone has rightly said, &quot;Those
who look at the sun don't see the
shadows.&quot; How true!<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Then Jonah prayed
unto the Lord his
God out of the fish's
belly&quot; (Jonah 2:1).</em></strong><br>
<br>
So learn to<em><strong> </strong></em>subdue your pains, disease
or financial condition and
worship the Lord instead.
Love Him with all your
heart, for He's good and
real, more real than whatever
situation you're going
through.</p>
