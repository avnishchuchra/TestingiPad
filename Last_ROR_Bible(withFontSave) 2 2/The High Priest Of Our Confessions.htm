OF OUR CONFESSIONS</b></font></p>



<p class="articles"><font size="+3">B</font>ack in the Old Testament, the
Lord said to Moses, <em>&quot;...take
thou unto thee Aaron thy brother,
and his sons with him, from among the
children of Israel, that he may minister
unto me in the priest's office...&quot;</em> (Exodus
28:1). By that directive, God instituted
the priesthood, with Aaron as the first
high priest. However, God wasn't
satisfied with those sacrifices of
animals, because true sacrifice is
spiritual.
In the New Testament, God expects
us to offer the calves of our lips
(Hosea 14:2), not bulls and calves on
a physical altar. From Hebrews 3:1,
we see that under the New Testament,
Jesus is our High Priest,
meaning He is the one
ordained by God to
receive the sacrifices we
have to offer. Hebrews
13:15 says &quot;By Him (Jesus)
therefore, let us offer the
calves of our lips, giving
thanks to His Name.&quot;
The expression &quot;giving
thanks to His Name&quot; is
akin to the Greek word
&quot;homologeo,&quot; which means &quot;to make
confessions to His Name.&quot; It means
&quot;to speak the same thing in consent
with another.&quot; For example, when
you say, &quot;I'm more than a conqueror
through Christ Jesus,&quot; or &quot;Greater is
He that is in me,' you're offering
sacrifices through your High Priest!
Jesus receives such confessions of
faith and presents them before the
Father.
This is why you must take
advantage of the Lord's ministry as
the High Priest of your confessions
and offer good sacrifices unto God
everyday by declaring what His
Word says about you. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Wherefore, holy
brethren, partakers of
the heavenly calling,
consider the Apostle
and High Priest of
our profession, Christ
Jesus&quot;
(Hebrews 3:1).</em></strong><br>
<br>
Recognize<em><strong> </strong></em>that your confessions of
faith create realities;
they're the materials with
which Jesus builds His
temple, and you are that
temple (1 Corinthians
3:16).</p>
