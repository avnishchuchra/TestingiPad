<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>THE TRANSFORMING POWER OF <br>
THE WORD</b></font></p>


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Word of God has the
ability to produce what it talks
about. When it addresses a particular
situation, divine power is released,
thereby causing that situation to align
with the Word. For example, when
God was creating the world, He
didn't have to roll out bulldozers and
cranes from heaven. All He did was
speak; He released His Word and by
it created the whole
world.
God's Word is the
solution to every challenge.
It is potent and
efficacious. It's the infallible
universal panacea. It
has inherent ability to
cause changes. This is
why it's imperative for
you as a Christian to
study and imbibe God's
Word, for it has the ability
to transform your life,
energize you for victory,
and programme you for
success.
As you meditate on
the Word, there's a transformation,
a metamorphosis, that
takes place in your life; the Word
produces in you what it talks about.
If a poor person for example,
keeps s tudying and confessing
the Word regarding his inheritance
and riches in Christ, his life will be
compelled to go in that direction.
That's the transforming ability of
God's Word; it comes to you with<em><strong> </strong></em>the capacity and power
to make you exactly
what it says.
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;And be not
conformed to this
world: but be ye
transformed by the
renewing of your
mind, that ye may
prove what is that
good, and acceptable,
and perfect, will of
God&quot; (Romans 12:2).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
If you're facing any
difficulty in your life
today, or maybe you
simply desire a change,
don't despair. What you
need is to get into the
Word and locate the
scriptures that deal with
that situation and begin
to meditate on them.
There'll be a transformation;
a positive change
will be effected in your
life!</p>
