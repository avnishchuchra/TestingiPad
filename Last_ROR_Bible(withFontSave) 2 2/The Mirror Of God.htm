<p class="articles"><font size="+3">H</font>ave you ever left home in a
hurry because you were
running late for work, only to be told
later in the office that you didn't
comb your hair? Such an experience
can be most embarrassing, but could
easily be avoided by you taking out
time to look in a mirror. There are
times you're so sure something is
wrong with your make-up though
you can't see it. It's at such times you
need to check your face in a mirror,
otherwise you would be uncomfortable
throughout the day. Now
you see why mirrors are so important
and why most people never think
they've finished dressing up until
they've observed themselves
in a mirror.
James likened the
Word of God to a mirror.
This is quite significant
because it vividly describes
how we should
apply the Word to our
lives.
When you look into a
mirror, who do you see?
You see you! That means
you ought to see yourself when you
look in the mirror of God. &quot;But we
all, with open face beholding as in a
glass the glory of the Lord, are
changed into the same image from
glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of
Lord&quot; (2 Corinthians 3:18). When
you look in the mirror of God, which
is the Word, you see the glory of
God, and that is you! And the more
you look into the Word, the more
you become what you see in the
Word. There's a transformation, a
transfiguration that takes place in
your life from one level of glory to a
higher level of glory. Hallelujah!
Get a hold of what I'm sharing<em><strong> </strong></em>with you; take the Mirror
and observe yourself in
a way you've never
done before. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;For if any be a
hearer of the word,
and not a doer, he
is like unto a man
beholding his natural
face in a glass: For
he beholdeth himself,
and goeth his way, and
straightway forgetteth
what manner of man
he was&quot;
(James 1:23-24).</em></strong><br>
<br>
Don't go
by what you feel or what
you see, look into the
Word of God and live
your life according to
what you've observed;
that is, according to the
Word of God.</p>
