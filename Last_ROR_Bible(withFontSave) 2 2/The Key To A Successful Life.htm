<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>J</b></font>oshua chapter 1 verse 8 is the
key to a successful life. It says
this book of the law shall not depart
from your mouth, not from your heart.
This means you must continually talk
the Word. That is what it means to
meditate on the Word; it connotes
muttering or speaking the Word to
yourself. Whether you're talking the
Word quietly under your breath or
you're roaring it out aloud,
whichever the case,
meditating on the Word
is God's recipe for success.
You may have the Word
in your heart, but if you
don't &quot;talk it,&quot; things
won't change.
In the first chapter of
Genesis, the Bible reveals
that the world remained a
chaotic mass until God
spoke (Genesis 1:2-4).
Talking the Word is of
utmost importance to the
believer (Romans 10:10), a
man is not saved by his
believing only but by his
confession. The reason is
that the righteousness which is of
faith doesn't keep quiet; it speaks
(Romans 10:6). God reveals Himself
to you through the Word that you
take into your heart.
However, that revelation alone
wouldn't change the circumstances
of your life. But by the time the Word
gets to your mouth and you speak it
forth, it becomes 'Rhema' (Greek)



-<em><strong> </strong></em>the active or creative
Word. This creative Word
is powerful and will
always produce results.
<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;This book of the
law shall not depart
out of thy mouth; but
thou shalt meditate
therein day and
night, that thou
mayest observe to do
according to all that
is written therein: for
then thou shalt make
thy way prosperous,
and then thou shalt
have good success&quot;
(Joshua 1:8).</strong></em><br>
<br>
To live the life of
success God has called
you into, you must be a
Word-talker. There aren't
enough limitations in the
world to stop you when
you have the Word of
God in your mouth. God's
Word in your mouth is
the hope for your future.
If you get a hold of this
truth, it'll catapult you to
the mountain top, where
you'll be gazing together
with Jesus at a world full
of possibilities.</p>
