<p class="articles"><font size="+3">H</font>anging out with the wrong
crowd negatively impacts
on a person's character. That's the
reason the Bible admonishes us not
to keep company with the wrong
friends, especially non-Christians.
Oftentimes, such friends try to
pressurize the believer to do the
things he used to do before he
received salvation.
As one who is born again, you
must get away from so-called friends
who are capable of exerting negative
influences on you. The Bible says,
&quot;Be ye not unequally yoked together
with unbelievers: ...&quot;(2 Corinthians
6:14). That doesn't mean they have
become your enemies,
for you ought to still reach
them with the gospel. But
the point is they shouldn't
be your close companions
in life; you shouldn't be
hobnobbing with them
anymore.
Also, there are some
in the Church who,
though born again, are
still carnal and behave
just like unbelievers. They're tonguetalking
believers, but there's no
godly piety about their lives. They
can advise you to do the same things
unbelievers do; you've got to be
careful of these as well.
When Daniel was in a precarious
situation, the Bible says he returned
home and told his three friends so
together they would <em>&quot;...desire mercies
of the God of heaven concerning this
secret; that Daniel and his fellows
should not perish with the rest of the
wise men of Babylon&quot; (Daniel 2:18).</em> Isn't this beautiful? Even though he
was a prophet, he still had friends who
could pray with him every now and<em><strong> </strong></em>then.
<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;Be not deceived:
evil communications
corrupt good
manners&quot;
(1 Corinthians 15:33).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
Those are the kind of
godly friends you ought to
keep-friends who inspire
you to pray, win souls and
love the Lord more! Friends
who inspire you to go to
church and do all the
things that God loves, not
friends who dissipate your
zeal and passion for the
things of the Spirit.</p>
