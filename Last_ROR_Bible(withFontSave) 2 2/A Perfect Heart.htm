<b>PASTOR CHRIS</b><br>

<P align="center"><font size="+2"><b>A PERFECT HEART</b></font></p>


<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>A</b></font>maziah was a great king of
Israel whose life reveals
many things. The Bible says that he
did what was right before God but
not with a perfect heart (2 Chronicles
25:1-2). In other words, he did the
right things but not with loyalty. It is
possible to do all the right things and
still not get God's approval because
of the wrong attitude or motive.
It's time to ask yourself, &quot;Who
really am I? What kind of a Christian
am I?&quot; What kind of attitude do you
have to the things of God? What
effect do you have on the people
who come close to you? What kind
of words come out of your mouth?
What kind of service do
you render to the Lord?
With what heart do you
do the things you do? Do
you have a loyal heart?
Are you after the things
of the flesh or the things
of the spirit? You ought
to examine yourself truthfully
in the light of God's
Word.
It is sad to see many of God's
people do what is right without
loyalty; but loyalty is a virtue that
every one of God's children has. It
only remains for us to develop and
use it. Jesus said a man's foes shall
be they of his own household
(Matthew 10:36). In churches where
there are problems of strife and
division, you will easily observe that
the problems were not caused by
outsiders, but by those in the church
who were not loyal to the cause of
the Gospel. Who are you, and how
do you do your work for the Lord?
Will your life be described like
Amaziah's who did what was right<em><strong> </strong></em>but not with a loyal
heart? <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;And (Amaziah) he
did that which was
right in the sight of
the LORD,
but not with a perfect
heart&quot; (2 Chronicles 25:2).</strong></em><br>
<br>
Or would you
rather be described like
David, who, though he
made several blunders,
still had the credentials
of a man after God's
heart with a repentant
attitude? (Acts 13:22).
It's your choice to make
today.</p>
