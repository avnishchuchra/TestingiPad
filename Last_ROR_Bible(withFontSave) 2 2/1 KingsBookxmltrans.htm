<div id="1 Kings 1" class="chapters" >Chapter 1</div>
<div id="1 Kings 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 1">a</a>Shunammite, and brought her to the king.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Then <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 2">b</a>Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 3">c</a>he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 4">d</a>and his mother bare him after Absalom.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 5">e</a>Abiathar the priest: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 6">f</a>they following Adonijah helped him.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 7">g</a>Shimei, and Rei, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 8">h</a>the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 9">i</a>Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 10">j</a>Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And she said unto him, My lord, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 11">k</a>thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 12">l</a>And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 13">m</a>sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 14">n</a>For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 15">o</a>God save king Adonijah.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 And the king sware, and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 16">p</a>As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 17">q</a>Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 18">r</a>Let my lord king David live for ever.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 The king also said unto them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 19">s</a>Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 20">t</a>Gihon:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:34" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;34 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 21">u</a>anoint him there king over Israel: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 22">v</a>blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:36" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:37" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;37 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 23">w</a>As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 24">x</a>make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:38" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;38 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 25">y</a>and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:39" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;39 And Zadok the priest took an horn of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 26">z</a>oil out of the tabernacle, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 27">a</a>anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 28">b</a>and all the people said, God save king Solomon.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:40" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;40 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:41" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;41 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:42" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;42 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 29">c</a>thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:43" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;43 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:44" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;44 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:45" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;45 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:46" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;46 And also Solomon <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 30">d</a>sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:47" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;47 And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 31">e</a>God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 32">f</a>And the king bowed himself upon the bed.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:48" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;48 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 33">g</a>given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:49" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;49 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:50" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;50 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 34">h</a>caught hold on the horns of the altar.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:51" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;51 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:52" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;52 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 35">i</a>there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 1:53" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;53 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="1 Kings 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 36">a</a>the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 37">b</a>I go the way of all the earth: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 38">c</a>be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 39">d</a>prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 That the LORD may <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 40">e</a>continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 41">f</a>If thy children take heed to their way, to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 42">g</a>walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 43">h</a>there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 44">i</a>did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 45">j</a>Abner the son of Ner, and unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 46">k</a>Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Do therefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 47">l</a>according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 But shew kindness unto the sons of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 48">m</a>Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 49">n</a>eat at thy table: for so <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 50">o</a>they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And, behold, thou hast with thee <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 51">p</a>Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 52">q</a>he came down to meet me at Jordan, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 53">r</a>I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Now therefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 54">s</a>hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 55">t</a>bring thou down to the grave with blood.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 So <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 56">u</a>David slept with his fathers, and was buried in <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 57">v</a>the city of David.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And the days that David <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 58">w</a>reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 59">x</a>Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 60">y</a>Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 61">z</a>mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 62">a</a>it was his from the LORD.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Kings 2:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 64">c</a>bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 65">d</a>and she sat on his right hand.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Kings 2:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 66">e</a>Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 67">f</a>God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 68">g</a>promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 69">h</a>Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 70">i</a>because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 71">j</a>thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 72">k</a>fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 73">l</a>had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom.

<div id="1 Kings 2:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar.

<div id="1 Kings 2:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 And the king said unto him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 75">n</a>Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 76">o</a>that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 And the LORD <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 77">p</a>shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 78">q</a>and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 79">r</a>Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 80">s</a>Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 81">t</a>upon the head of his seed for ever: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 82">u</a>but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:34" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;34 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 83">v</a>Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 84">w</a>Abiathar.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:36" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;36 And the king sent and called for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 85">x</a>Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Kings 2:39" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;39 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 88">a</a>Achish son of Maachah king of Gath.

<div id="1 Kings 2:40" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;40 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:41" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;41 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Kings 2:43" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;43 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:44" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;44 The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 89">b</a>all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 90">c</a>return thy wickedness upon thine own head;  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:45" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;45 And king Solomon shall be blessed, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 91">d</a>the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 2:46" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;46 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died.

<div id="1 Kings 18:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And it came to pass after <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 568">a</a>many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 569">b</a>I will send rain upon the earth.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 570">c</a>the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 571">d</a>Art thou he that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 572">e</a>troubleth Israel?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 573">f</a>in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 574">g</a>Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 575">h</a>and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 576">i</a>gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 577">j</a>How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 578">k</a>Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 Then said Elijah unto the people, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 579">l</a>I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 580">m</a>but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 581">n</a>answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 582">o</a>no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And they cried aloud, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 583">p</a>cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 584">q</a>and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 585">r</a>neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 586">s</a>And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 587">t</a>Israel shall be thy name:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 And with the stones he built an altar <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 588">u</a>in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 And he <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 589">v</a>put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 590">w</a>pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:34" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;34 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 591">x</a>the trench also with water.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:36" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;36 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 592">y</a>God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 593">z</a>let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 594">a</a>I have done all these things at thy word.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:37" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;37 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:38" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;38 Then <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 595">b</a>the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:39" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 596">c</a>The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:40" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;40 And Elijah said unto them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 597">d</a>Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.

<div id="1 Kings 18:41" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;41 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:42" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 599">f</a>and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:43" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;43 And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 18:44" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand.

<div id="1 Kings 19:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 602">b</a>So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Kings 22:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 667">e</a>Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?  </div></br>

And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 22:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 22:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 22:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Kings 22:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Kings 668">f</a>what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 22:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 So he came to the king.

<div id="1 Kings 22:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?  </div></br>

<div id="1 Kings 22:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 22:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Kings 22:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Kings 22:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;  </div></br>

<div id="1 Kings 22:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Kings 22:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.  </div></br>
