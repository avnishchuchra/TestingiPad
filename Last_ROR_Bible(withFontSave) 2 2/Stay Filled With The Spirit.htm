<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>STAY FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT</b></font></p>



<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he fact that you've received
the Holy Spirit doesn't mean
you're always filled with the Spirit. To
be filled with the Spirit doesn't mean
you've lost your mind as some people
think! It means you're functioning
under the control and influence of
the Holy Spirit twenty-four hours
every day. That's how God wants
you to live.
Note that you don't get filled with
the Spirit simply because you said,
&quot;I'm now filled with the Spirit.&quot; There
are things you do that get you filled
with the Spirit. They're listed in the
nineteenth verse of Ephesians chapter
five: <em>&quot;Speaking to yourselves (not
others) in psalms and
hymns and spiritual songs,
singing and making melody
in your heart to the Lord.&quot;</em> This is how to be filled
with the Spirit.
&quot;Psalms&quot; are spiritual
poems sung or spoken to
God in worship. &quot;Hymns&quot;
are songs of thanksgiving
and praise directed to God or about
God. &quot;Spiritual songs&quot; are prophetic
songs that come to you from the
realm of the spirit. Such songs are
filled with the Word of God, and
sometimes they may come to you in
other tongues. Then he says to
&quot;make melody in your heart to
God.&quot; Your melody might not sound
melodious to someone else, but
you're getting so blessed as you sing
to the Lord!
Never leave home or embark on
any endeavour without being filled
with the Spirit. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;And be not drunk
with wine, wherein is
excess; but be filled
with the Spirit&quot;
(Ephesians 5:18).</em></strong><br>
<br>
A good way to always
get yourself in the flow of the Spirit
is to start by speaking in other<em><strong> </strong></em>tongues. Before long, the
words and songs of the
Spirit will well up in
you.
You can't be filled
with the Spirit and experience
sickness, failure,
or lack. Your spirit will
continually be energized
for victory and success
every day.</p>
