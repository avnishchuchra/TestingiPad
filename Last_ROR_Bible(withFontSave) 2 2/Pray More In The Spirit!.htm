<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Spirit of God, through the
Apostle Paul, juxtaposes two
kinds of prayer in 1 Corinthians 14:
&quot;praying with the spirit&quot; and &quot;praying
with the understanding.&quot; However,
His call to us is that we pray more
with the spirit. That's why Paul said,
  <em>&quot;I will pray with the spirit, and I will
pray with the understanding also,&quot;</em> letting us know that praying with the
spirit takes preeminence
over praying with the
understanding.
When you pray with the
spirit, your understanding
is unfruitful; your mind
doesn't get what you're
saying, because it's coming
from your spirit. But when
you pray with the understanding,
you're praying
in a language you understand,
through your mind.
The proper order and
priority in our prayer as
revealed in Scripture is to
<em>&quot;pray with the spirit, and
then pray with the understanding
also.&quot;</em> Praying
with the understanding is the &quot;also&quot; part of the equation. So you ought
to pray more with the spirit, by
speaking in other tongues.
If you have it in the reverse order,
you'll be shortchanging yourself.
Sadly, some Christians start out by
praying in their understanding and
interject the prayer with a little
praying in the spirit. That's not the<em><strong> </strong></em>right order! <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;For if I pray in
an unknown tongue,
my spirit prayeth, but
my understanding
is unfruitful. What
is it then? I will
pray with the spirit,
and I will pray with
the understanding
also: I will sing
with the spirit, and
I will sing with the
understanding also&quot;
(1 Corinthians 14:14-15).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
The Spirit's
admonition is for you to
pray more in other
tongues than in your
understanding. When
you pray in this manner,
your life will be dominated
by the Spirit and
not the senses. Your
response to situations
will always be from the
standpoint of the Spirit!
So make it a conscious
practice to pray
more in other tongues.
Let praying in the spirit
take the most part of
your prayer time.</p>
