<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>YOU NEED SELF-CONTROL</b></font></p>
 


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he man who has no control
over his spirit is like a city
whose walls are broken down. This
means he's vulnerable to attack and
anything could bring him down. The
devil could come into his life at any
time and attack his family, his job, his
business or his health. On the other
hand, Proverbs 16:32 says, <em>&quot;...he that
rules his spirit is better than he that
takes a city.&quot; </em>In other words, it's
better to have self-control than to be
a great warrior that doesn't have rule
over his spirit.
A Christian who has rule over his
spirit is like a city fortified with protective
walls that deter any invader.
He is well covered and
gives no room to the
devil. He doesn't just
receive anything that
comes his way, or accept
every word he's told. He
doesn't do just anything
his mind tells him to do;
he has God's Word as
his defense and standard.
His spirit has gained the mastery
over his mind and his body because
he has been transformed through
the renewing of his mind.
Train your spirit through the
Word; that way, you'll be able to
decipher the good, the acceptable
and the perfect will of God, and can
choose the perfect will to walk in it
(Romans 12:2). As you stay in the
Word of God-hearing it, studying it,
speaking it and doing it, your faith
will be built, and you'll also be able
to repel every dart the enemy throws
at you.
Your faith is your protective shield
against all the wiles of the enemy,<strong><em> </em></strong> hence, the reason you
must spend time building
your faith-muscles.<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot; He that hath no
rule over his own
spirit is like a city that
is broken down, and
without walls&quot; (Proverbs 25:28)</em></strong>.<br>
<br>
You
need self-control because
conquer ing your sel f
would be your greatest
conquest.</p>
