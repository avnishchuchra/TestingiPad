<div id="1 Samuel 1" class="chapters" >Chapter 1</div>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Eph-raim, and his name was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 1">a</a>Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 2">b</a>an Ephrathite:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And this man went up out of his city <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 3">c</a>yearly <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 4">d</a>to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 5">e</a>Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And when the time was that Elkanah <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 6">f</a>offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 7">g</a>but the LORD had shut up her womb.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And her adversary also <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 8">h</a>provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 9">i</a>better to thee than ten sons?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 10">j</a>the temple of the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 11">k</a>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And she <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 12">l</a>vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 13">m</a>look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 14">n</a>remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 15">o</a>there shall no razor come upon his head.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 16">p</a>poured out my soul before the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 17">q</a>Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Then Eli answered and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 18">r</a>Go in peace: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 19">s</a>the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And she said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 20">t</a>Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 21">u</a>went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 22">v</a>knew Hannah his wife; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 23">w</a>the LORD remembered her.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 24">x</a>went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 25">y</a>bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 26">z</a>abide <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 27">a</a>for ever.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 28">b</a>Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 29">c</a>only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And when she had weaned him, she <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 30">d</a>took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 31">e</a>the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And they slew a bullock, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 32">f</a>brought the child to Eli.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And she said, Oh my lord, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 33">g</a>as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 34">h</a>For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 1:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 35">i</a>Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 36">j</a>worshipped the LORD there.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And Hannah <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 37">a</a>prayed, and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 38">b</a>My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 39">c</a>mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 40">d</a>rejoice in thy salvation.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 41">e</a>There is none holy as the LORD: for there is <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 42">f</a>none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 43">g</a>let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 44">h</a>The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 45">i</a>They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 46">j</a>the barren hath born seven; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 47">k</a>she that hath many children is waxed feeble.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 48">l</a>The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 The LORD <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 49">m</a>maketh poor, and maketh rich: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 50">n</a>he bringeth low, and lifteth up.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Samuel 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 The adversaries of the LORD shall be <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 55">s</a>broken to pieces; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 56">t</a>out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 57">u</a>the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 58">v</a>exalt the horn of his anointed.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 59">w</a>And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Now the sons of Eli were <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 60">x</a>sons of Belial; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 61">y</a>they knew not the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And the priests' custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Also before they <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 62">z</a>burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 63">a</a>before the LORD: for men <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 64">b</a>abhorred the offering of the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 65">c</a>But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 66">d</a>girded with a linen ephod.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 67">e</a>came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And Eli <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 68">f</a>blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 69">g</a>lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And the LORD <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 70">h</a>visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 71">i</a>grew before the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 72">j</a>the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 73">k</a>sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 74">l</a>because the LORD would slay them.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And the child Samuel <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 75">m</a>grew on, and was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 76">n</a>in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 77">o</a>And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 78">p</a>Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 2:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And did I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 79">q</a>choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 80">r</a>did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?  </div></br>

<div id="1 Samuel 2:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 83">u</a>I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 84">v</a>Be it far from me; for them that honour me <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 85">w</a>I will honour, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 86">x</a>they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Samuel 14:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 367">t</a>with the blood.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:34" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;34 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 And Saul <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 368">u</a>built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:36" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;36 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:37" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;37 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 369">v</a>he answered him not that day.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:38" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;38 And Saul said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 370">w</a>Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:39" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;39 For, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 371">x</a>as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.

<div id="1 Samuel 14:40" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;40 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:41" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;41 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 372">y</a>Give a perfect lot. <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 373">z</a>And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:42" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;42 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:43" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 374">a</a>Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 375">b</a>I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:44" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;44 And Saul answered, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 376">c</a>God do so and more also: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 377">d</a>for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:45" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;45 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 378">e</a>as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:46" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;46 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:47" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;47 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 379">f</a>Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 380">g</a>Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:48" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;48 And he gathered an host, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 381">h</a>smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 14:49" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;49 Now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 382">i</a>the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:  </div></br>

<div id="1 Samuel 15:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 386">b</a>how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 15:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Now go and smite Amalek, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 387">c</a>utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Samuel 15:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And Saul said unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 388">d</a>the Kenites, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 389">e</a>Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 390">f</a>ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.

<div id="1 Samuel 16:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 16:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And it came to pass, when <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 454">h</a>the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Samuel 17:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;  </div></br>

<div id="1 Samuel 17:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 469">o</a>according to the same words: and David heard them.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 17:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 17:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 470">p</a>will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Samuel 17:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 And David said, What have I now done? <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 477">w</a>Is there not a cause?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 17:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 And he turned from him toward another, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 478">x</a>spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Samuel 17:43" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;43 And the Philistine said unto David, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 486">f</a>Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves?

<div id="1 Samuel 20:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 559">d</a>If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 560">e</a>evil is determined by him.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Therefore thou shalt <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 561">f</a>deal kindly with thy servant; for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 562">g</a>thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 563">h</a>if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 564">i</a>The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 565">j</a>the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 But also <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 566">k</a>thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 567">l</a>Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 568">m</a>for he loved him as he loved his own soul.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Then Jonathan said to David, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 569">n</a>To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 570">o</a>the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 571">p</a>as the LORD liveth.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And as touching <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 572">q</a>the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 573">r</a>not clean.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And Jonathan <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 574">s</a>answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 575">t</a>Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 And Saul <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 576">u</a>cast a javelin at him to smite him: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 577">v</a>whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:34" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:36" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;36 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:37" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;37 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:38" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;38 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:39" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;39 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:40" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;40 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:41" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;41 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 20:42" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;42 And Jonathan said to David, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 578">w</a>Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.

<div id="1 Samuel 21:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Then came David to Nob to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 579">a</a>Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 580">b</a>afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 21:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 21:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 21:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 581">c</a>hallowed bread; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 582">d</a>if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 21:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 583">e</a>vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 584">f</a>in the vessel.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 21:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 So the priest <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 585">g</a>gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 586">h</a>that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 21:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 587">i</a>Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 21:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 21:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 588">j</a>the valley of Elah, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 589">k</a>behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 21:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 21:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 590">l</a>the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 591">m</a>Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 21:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And David <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 592">n</a>laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 21:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 593">o</a>he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 21:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?  </div></br>

<div id="1 Samuel 25:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 They were <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 669">n</a>a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 670">o</a>evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 671">p</a>Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Then Abigail made haste, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 672">q</a>took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And she said unto her servants, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 673">r</a>Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 674">s</a>requited me evil for good.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 675">t</a>So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 676">u</a>leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 677">v</a>any that pisseth against the wall.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 678">w</a>and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 Now therefore, my lord, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 679">x</a>as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 680">y</a>withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 681">z</a>avenging thyself with thine own hand, now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 682">a</a>let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 And now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 683">b</a>this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 684">c</a>the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 685">d</a>fighteth the battles of the LORD, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 686">e</a>evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 687">f</a>sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 And David said to Abigail, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 688">g</a>Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 689">h</a>kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:34" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;34 For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 690">i</a>kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 691">j</a>not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 692">k</a>Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 693">l</a>accepted thy person.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:36" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;36 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 694">m</a>he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:37" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;37 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:38" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;38 And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:39" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;39 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 695">n</a>Blessed be the LORD, that hath <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 696">o</a>pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 697">p</a>kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 698">q</a>returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:40" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;40 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:41" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;41 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 699">r</a>thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:42" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;42 And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:43" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;43 David also took Ahinoam <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 700">s</a>of Jezreel; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 701">t</a>and they were also both of them his wives.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 25:44" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;44 But Saul had given <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 702">u</a>Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 703">v</a>Gallim.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26" class="chapters" >Chapter 26</div>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 704">a</a>Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 705">b</a>Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 706">c</a>the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 707">d</a>go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 708">e</a>for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 709">f</a>the LORD shall smite him; or <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 710">g</a>his day shall come to die; or he shall <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 711">h</a>descend into battle, and perish.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 712">i</a>The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 713">j</a>a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And Saul knew David's voice, and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 714">k</a>Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And he said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 715">l</a>Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 716">m</a>stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 717">n</a>for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 718">o</a>inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 719">p</a>a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 Then said Saul, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 720">q</a>I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 721">r</a>precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 722">s</a>The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 26:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 723">t</a>prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 27" class="chapters" >Chapter 27</div>
<div id="1 Samuel 27:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 27:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And David arose, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 724">a</a>and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 725">b</a>unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 27:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 726">c</a>with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Car-melitess, Nabal's wife.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 27:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 27:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 27:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 727">d</a>Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 27:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Samuel 27:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And David and his men went up, and invaded <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 728">e</a>the Geshurites, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 729">f</a>and the Gezrites, and the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 730">g</a>Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Samuel 731">h</a>as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.  </div></br>
