<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>YOU CAN KNOW ALL THINGS</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Bible says all of the treasures
of wisdom and knowledge
are hidden in Christ, and we know
that Christ in the context of this
Scripture doesn't refer to Jesus alone:
&quot;we, being many, are one body in
Christ, and every one members one
of another&quot; (Romans 12:5). In other
words, Christ refers to the Church, of
which Jesus is the Head and we are
His body. Thus, if all the
treasures of wisdom and
knowledge are hid in
Christ, that means nothing
ought to be beyond your
scope of knowledge as a
child of God.
No wonder the Bible
declares that we have an
anointing from the Holy
One and we know all
things (1 John 2:20). That
anointing dwells in your
spirit, which is the real
you. That's where the light
of God shines and it's
through your spirit that
you can draw from the
boundless treasure-house
of God's knowledge.
Let me give you a practical
example: Maybe you misplaced something
and had tried fruitlessly to
remember where you kept it. In your
mind, there's no clue as to where
and how to find it. But do you know
that your spirit doesn't forget? If you
would activate your spirit by speaking
in tongues, your spirit will begin to<em><strong> </strong></em>function as a searchlight!
Before long, your spirit
will send signals to your
mind and you'll know
where that thing is.

<br>
<strong><em>&quot;That their hearts
might be comforted,
being knit together
in love, and unto
all riches of the
full assurance of
understanding, to the
acknowledgement of
the mystery of God,
and of the Father,
and of Christ; In
whom are hid all the
treasures of wisdom
and knowledge&quot;
(Colossians 2:2-3).</em></strong><br>
<br>
Someone may ask,
&quot;Does this really work?&quot;
Emphatically yes! No
child of God should be in
the dark about anything.
Should there be anything
you need knowledge
about? Through the
agency of the Holy Spirit,
you can access knowledge
of any topic in the
world.</p>
