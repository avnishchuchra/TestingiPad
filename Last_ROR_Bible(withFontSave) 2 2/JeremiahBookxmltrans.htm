<div id="Jeremiah 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 1">a</a>in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 2">b</a>in the thirteenth year of his reign.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 3">c</a>unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 4">d</a>unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 5">e</a>in the fifth month.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Before I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 6">f</a>formed thee in the belly <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 7">g</a>I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 8">h</a>sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Then said I, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 9">i</a>Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 10">j</a>whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 11">k</a>Be not afraid of their faces: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 12">l</a>I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Then the LORD put forth his hand, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 13">m</a>touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 14">n</a>put my words in thy mouth.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 15">o</a>See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 16">p</a>root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 17">q</a>a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 18">r</a>north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 For, lo, I will <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 19">s</a>call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 20">t</a>set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 21">u</a>who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Thou therefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 22">v</a>gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 23">w</a>be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 For, behold, I have made thee this day <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 24">x</a>a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 25">y</a>for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Jeremiah 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 26">a</a>youth, the love of thine espousals, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 27">b</a>when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 28">c</a>Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 29">d</a>the firstfruits of his increase: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 30">e</a>all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Thus saith the LORD, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 31">f</a>What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 32">g</a>and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Neither said they, Where is the LORD that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 33">h</a>brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 34">i</a>the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And I brought you into <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 35">j</a>a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 36">k</a>defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 37">l</a>law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 38">m</a>and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 39">n</a>do not profit.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Wherefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 40">o</a>I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 41">p</a>with your children's children will I plead.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.  </div></br>

<div id="Jeremiah 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 47">v</a>fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Is Israel <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 48">w</a>a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled?  </div></br>

<div id="Jeremiah 26:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 866">f</a>If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,  </div></br>

<div id="Jeremiah 26:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 26:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 26:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant?

<div id="Jeremiah 26:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 26:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 870">j</a>for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.  </div></br>

<div id="Jeremiah 26:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.  </div></br>

<div id="Jeremiah 36:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 36:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 36:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, how didst thou write all these words at his mouth?  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 36:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 36:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.  </div></br>

<div id="Jeremiah 36:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber.

<div id="Jeremiah 36:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 36:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 Yet they were not afraid, nor <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 1167">m</a>rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 36:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 36:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 36:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,  </div></br>

<div id="Jeremiah 36:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 36:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 1168">n</a>He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 1169">o</a>cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 36:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 36:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.  </div></br>

<div id="Jeremiah 38:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 38:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 38:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.  </div></br>

<div id="Jeremiah 38:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 38:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 38:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD liveth, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 1193">k</a>that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.  </div></br>

<div id="Jeremiah 38:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chal-deans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 1197">o</a>mock me.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 38:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.  </div></br>
<div id="Jeremiah 38:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me:  </div></br>

<div id="Jeremiah 38:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 So they shall bring out all thy wives and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 1198">p</a>thy children to the Chaldeans: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jeremiah 1199">q</a>thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.  </div></br>

<div id="Jeremiah 38:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded.
