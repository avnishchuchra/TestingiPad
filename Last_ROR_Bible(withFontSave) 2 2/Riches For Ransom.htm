<P class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he things God has given you
aren't just for you to store up
and look at. They're for you to
redeem your soul. They're for you to
ransom your life and that of your
loved ones. There are times when all
your talking and quoting of scripture
wouldn't be enough. At those times,
only a sacrificial offering will settle
the problem! Therefore, all you
need do is look around your house
and pull out that sacrifice and place it
on the altar of God.
A dear friend of mine, who is a
minister of God, once shared the
testimony of how his daughter got
sick and wouldn't get well even after
series of intense prayers.
The doctors couldn't diagnose
what was wrong
with the little girl. Her
lips became black and
everyone who saw her
wondered what kind of
sickness she was suffering
from. Every attempt at getting the
child well just didn't work. Then he
opened his wardrobe and packed
out all his suits which were about
thirty and took them to church, and
gave them as an offering. A few days
after giving that offering, his daughter
was miraculously restored to health.
Many Christians don't understand
this stuff and that's why they get into
all kinds of trouble. When you study
Solomon's life you'll discover that
the key to his success was in his
giving; he was a man who distinguished
himself with his offering.
Not even David, his father, gave as
much as he did. This was why God<em><strong> </strong></em>appeared to him after
his phenomenal sacrifice
and said, <em>&quot;Ask what you
will&quot;</em> (1 Kings 3:2-5). <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;The ransom of
a man's life are his
riches: but the poor
heareth not rebuke&quot; (Proverbs 13:8). </em></strong><br>
<br> 
His
giving endeared him to
the heart of God.</P>
