<div id="Deuteronomy 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.  </div></br>
<div id="Deuteronomy 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And when we departed from Horeb, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Deuteronomy 21">u</a>we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Deuteronomy 22">v</a>we came to Kadeshbarnea.  </div></br>
<div id="Deuteronomy 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.  </div></br>

<div id="Deuteronomy 1:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And the saying pleased me well: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Deuteronomy 24">x</a>I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:  </div></br>
