<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>KNOW HOW TO STIR UP THE<br>ANOINTING IN YOU</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>D</b></font>o you remember the story
of Samson in the Bible? He
accomplished supernatural feats
when the anointing came on him
mightily. He killed a lion with his bare
hands (Judges 14:5-6), defeated one
thousand men with the jawbone of
an ass (Judges 15:15-16) and carried
the gates of a city on his shoulders
up a hill (Judges 16:3).
If you don't study the life of
Samson thoroughly, you may not
know the role he had to play in
activating that anointing. After he was
betrayed by Delilah and his hair was
shaved, the Bible says he<em>&quot;...awoke
out of his sleep, and said, I will go out
as at other times before,
and shake myself...&quot; (Judges
16:20).</em> I want you to note
that he didn't say, &quot;I will
go out as at other times
before, and jump up;&quot;
rather, he said &quot;...shake
myself.&quot; It's very important
to note this! You see,
Samson knew that the
anointing was triggered
whenever he shook
himself! It wasn't enough for his hair
to be long, even though that was the
symbol of the power of God in his
life; he had to shake himself to
trigger-off the anointing.
Over in the New Testament, the
Bible says, <em>&quot;...the anointing which ye
have received of him abideth in you...&quot; </em>(1 John 2:27). That means unlike
Samson, the anointing is in your spirit.
But this anointing wouldn't work just
because it's there. You need to know
the things that'll stir up the anointing
in your own life. This was why Apostle
Paul, in his letter to Timothy, reminded
him to stir up the anointing in him
continually (2 Timothy 1:6).<em><strong> <br>
<br>
&quot;And she said, The
Philistines be upon
thee, Samson. And
he awoke out of his
sleep, and said, I will
go out as at other
times before, and
shake myself. And
he wist not that the
LORD was departed
from him&quot;
(Judges 16:20).<br>
<br>
</strong></em>One sure way to stir
up the anointing is by
speaking in other tongues.
The Bible says, <em>&quot;He that
speaketh in an unknown
tongue edifieth himself...&quot;</em> (1 Corinthians 14:4).
When that anointing is
triggered, anything is
possible. Don't be content
to live an ordinary life;
trigger off the anointing
everyday!</p>
