THE POWER OF GOD</b></font></p>
<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he power of God came into
your life the day you received
the Holy Spirit: &quot;But ye shall receive
power, after that the Holy Ghost is
come upon you..&quot; (Acts 1:8).
However, this doesn't mean the
power is active already; you've got
to activate it. That's why Paul told
Timothy to stir up the gift of God in
him. He was referring to the power
of the Holy Spirit, which can be
dormant in your spirit unless you
activate it.
Sad to say that some folks have
received the power of God (having
been born again and filled with the
Holy Spirit), but have allowed that
power lie dormant in
them. So, often times you
find them praying to God
for what already belongs
to them. The Lord, through
His Word, shows us that
we're responsible for
activating His power in
us. Paul didn't say to
Timothy, &quot;Pray to God to
stir up the gift in you,&quot; for
it's not God's responsibility,
but yours.
When you pray in tongues, you
stir up the power of God resident in
your spirit. You're converting the
&quot;latent energy&quot; of the Spirit in you
into &quot;kinetic energy&quot; as it were.
Suddenly, that power that was
quietly nestling in your spirit is
activated and you're transfigured!
You're suddenly infused with divine
strength, and the glory of God is
revealed through you.
It's no use praying to God to &quot;send
more power down from heaven&quot; or
&quot;send more anointing&quot;; the anointing,
which is the power of God, is in you
already, but you have to activate it<em><strong> </strong></em>and put it to work. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Wherefore I put
thee in remembrance
that thou stir up the
gift of God, which is
in thee by the putting
on of my hands&quot; (2 Timothy 1:6).</em></strong><br>
<br>
That's
what I'm showing you-
how to activate the power
of God in you by speaking
in other tongues.
What a blessing this is!
You can turn the power
on whenever you choose,
wherever you are-by
speaking in tongues. Stir
up that power right now;
speak in other tongues.</p>
