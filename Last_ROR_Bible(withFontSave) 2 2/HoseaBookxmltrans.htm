<div id="Hosea 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 1">a</a>Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 2">b</a>the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 3">c</a>and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 4">d</a>and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 5">e</a>And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 6">f</a>for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 7">g</a>But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 8">h</a>will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Yet <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 9">i</a>the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 10">j</a>and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 11">k</a>Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 12">l</a>the sons of the living God.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 13">m</a>Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Hosea 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ru-hamah.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Plead with your mother, plead: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 14">a</a>she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 15">b</a>whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Lest <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 16">c</a>I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 17">d</a>born, and make her <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 18">e</a>as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 19">f</a>thirst.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 20">g</a>children of whoredoms.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 21">h</a>For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 22">i</a>that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Therefore, behold, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 23">j</a>I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 24">k</a>I will go and return to my <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 25">l</a>first husband; for then was it better with me than now.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 For she did not <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 26">m</a>know that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 27">n</a>I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Therefore will I return, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 28">o</a>take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 29">p</a>will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 30">q</a>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 31">r</a>feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 32">s</a>whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 33">t</a>I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 34">u</a>decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 35">v</a>bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 36">w</a>the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 37">x</a>the days of her youth, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 38">y</a>as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 39">z</a>I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And in that day will I make a <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 40">a</a>covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 41">b</a>I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 42">c</a>lie down safely.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 43">d</a>thou shalt know the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 2:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And it shall come to pass in that day, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 44">e</a>I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;  </div></br>

<div id="Hosea 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And I said unto her, Thou shalt <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 51">c</a>abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 For the children of Israel shall abide many days <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 52">d</a>without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 53">e</a>ephod, and without <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 54">f</a>teraphim:  </div></br>

<div id="Hosea 4:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 58">a</a>controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 59">b</a>knowledge of God in the land.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 4:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.  </div></br>

<div id="Hosea 4:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 62">e</a>that strive with the priest.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 4:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Therefore shalt thou fall <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 63">f</a>in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.  </div></br>
<div id="Hosea 4:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hosea 64">g</a>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.  </div></br>
