<div id="Ecclesiastes 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 12">l</a>this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 13">m</a>That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 14">n</a>more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.  </div></br>

<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 21">e</a>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 So <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 22">f</a>I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 23">g</a>this was my portion of all my labour.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 24">h</a>vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 25">i</a>and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 26">j</a>The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 27">k</a>one event happeneth to them all.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 28">l</a>I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 29">m</a>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 For all his days are <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 30">n</a>sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 31">o</a>There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 2:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 32">p</a>he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.  </div></br>

<div id="Ecclesiastes 3:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 40">h</a>no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.  </div></br>

<div id="Ecclesiastes 3:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 43">k</a>nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.  </div></br>

<div id="Ecclesiastes 4" class="chapters" >Chapter 4</div>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 4:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 So I returned, and considered all the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 54">a</a>oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.  </div></br>

<div id="Ecclesiastes 4:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 57">d</a>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.  </div></br>

<div id="Ecclesiastes 4:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.  </div></br>
<div id="Ecclesiastes 4:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 59">f</a>eye satisfied with riches; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ecclesiastes 60">g</a>neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good?
