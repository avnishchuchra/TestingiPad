<b>PASTOR CHRIS</b>
 
<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>DO THE IMPOSSIBLE!</b></font></p>



<p class="articles"><font size="+3">I</font> remember years ago, when I
heard that the youngest firstclass
graduate of mathematics from
the United Kingdom was a fifteenyear-
old, I was stunned. For a moment,
I tried to calculate how possible it was
for a fifteen-year-old to breeze so
quickly through high school. But then,
very quickly, it dawned on me that
God could do anything.
  <em>&quot;What if the kid didn't believe in
God?&quot;</em> you may want to ask. Well, in
Matthew 17:20, Jesus addressed a
group of people and told them nothing
shall be impossible to them. This
group of people weren't Christians at
the time, for it wasn't possible for
anyone to have been born
again since Jesus hadn't
died and resurrected.
Now, if people who
didn't have eternal life
were being told by Jesus
that they could use their
faith for anything, what
about you that are born
again, with the life and
nature of God in you? It
therefore means there's
no limit to how much you can
achieve in life! Understand that you've
been called to a life of unending
success, triumph and prosperity.
You have the supernatural ability to
do exploits because you're filled with
the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:8).
It's your set time to do the
impossible. All you need is to be
conscious of God's ability in you.
Think about it: if nothing is impossible
to you, it means you can do anything
and be everything God has planned
for you to be.
Rather than look forlorn and discouraged
when situations challenge
your faith, get excited, for Jesus<em><strong> </strong></em>already said nothing shall
be impossible unto you.
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;...For verily I say
unto you, If ye have
faith as a grain of
mustard seed, ye
shall say unto this
mountain, Remove
hence to yonder
place; and it shall
remove; and nothing
shall be impossible
unto you&quot; (Matthew 17:20).</em></strong> <br>
<br>
It doesn't matter the
strength of your adversaries,
refuse to cower
or be intimidated. Go
on and win today.</p>
