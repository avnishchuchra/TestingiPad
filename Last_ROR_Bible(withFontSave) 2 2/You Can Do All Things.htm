<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he word 'Christ' in Philippians
4:13 doesn't refer to the Man
Jesus; it means &quot;the Anointed One
and His anointing.&quot; It refers to the
supernatural empowerment Jesus
received when the Holy Spirit came
upon Him, which made Him the
Christ. You received the same Holy
Spirit when you were born again.
Thus, the same anointing that made
Jesus the Christ and gave Him the
ability to do the impossible is at work
in you. The apostle Paul understood
this truth, and by the Spirit said, &quot;I
can do all things through Christ which
strengtheneth me.&quot;
Like Paul, you ought to make this
your constant confession;
the ability of the Spirit
has been granted you to
achieve supernatural exploits
in life. The Bible says,
  <em>&quot;Not that we are sufficient
of ourselves to think any
thing as of ourselves; but
our sufficiency is of God&quot; </em>(2 Corinthians 3:5). The
word &quot;sufficiency&quot; in this
verse of scripture means
&quot;ability.&quot; The Spirit of God is letting
you know that you've been endued
with God's supernatural ability. Therefore,
look beyond what your physical
ability can do.
Never let your confidence rest in
your intellect or physical ability,
because there's a divine energy
available to you. That energy is the
power of the Holy Spirit which you
must recognize and put to work in
your life everyday. With you, nothing
is impossible. Cultivate the &quot;I-can-do
mentality&quot; and be possibility-conscious.
For example if a project or an
assignment is given to you in your<em><strong> </strong></em>place of work, no matter
how difficult it may look,
don't say it can't be
done. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;I can do all things
through Christ which
strengtheneth me&quot;
(Philippians 4:13).</em></strong><br>
<br>
Never say something
  is impossible; you
  have the ability of God
  in you, therefore you
  can do all things.
