<div id="Acts 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 7">g</a>For John truly baptized with water; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 8">h</a>but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 9">i</a>Lord, wilt thou at this time <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 10">j</a>restore again the kingdom to Israel?  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And he said unto them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 11">k</a>It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 12">l</a>But ye shall receive power, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 13">m</a>after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 14">n</a>ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 17">q</a>in white apparel;  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Which also said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 18">r</a>Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 19">s</a>shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And when they were come in, they went up <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 21">u</a>into an upper room, where abode both <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 22">v</a>Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 23">w</a>Simon Zelotes, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 24">x</a>Judas the brother of James.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 28">b</a>of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 29">c</a>which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 30">d</a>which was guide to them that took Jesus.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 31">e</a>he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 32">f</a>this ministry.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 33">g</a>Now this man purchased a field with <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 34">h</a>the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 35">i</a>Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 36">j</a>his bishoprick let another take.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 1:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And they appointed two, Joseph called <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 40">n</a>Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 1:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 41">o</a>which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 1:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 42">p</a>That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 1:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Acts 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And when <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 43">a</a>the day of Pentecost was fully come, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 44">b</a>they were all with one accord in one place.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 45">c</a>it filled all the house where they were sitting.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 46">d</a>they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 47">e</a>to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 48">f</a>Galilaeans?  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 49">g</a>seeing it is but the third hour of the day.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 53">k</a>and they shall prophesy:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 54">l</a>And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 55">m</a>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And it shall come to pass, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 56">n</a>whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 57">o</a>by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 Him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 58">p</a>being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 59">q</a>ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 60">r</a>Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 For David speaketh concerning him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 61">s</a>I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 62">t</a>of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 Therefore being a prophet, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 63">u</a>and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 64">v</a>that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 65">w</a>This Jesus hath God raised up, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 66">x</a>whereof we all are witnesses.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 Therefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 67">y</a>being by the right hand of God exalted, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 68">z</a>having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 69">a</a>hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:34" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 70">b</a>The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:36" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 71">c</a>hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:37" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;37 Now when they heard this, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 72">d</a>they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:38" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;38 Then Peter said unto them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 73">e</a>Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:39" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;39 For the promise is unto you, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 74">f</a>to your children, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 75">g</a>to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:40" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:41" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:42" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;42 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 76">h</a>And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:43" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;43 And fear came upon every soul: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 77">i</a>many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:44" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;44 And all that believed were together, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 78">j</a>had all things common;  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 2:45" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;45 And sold their possessions and goods, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 79">k</a>parted them to all men, as every man had need.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 11:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 408">a</a>they that were of the circumcision contended with him,  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 11:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 409">b</a>Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 410">c</a>and didst eat with them.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 11:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 412">e</a>I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 11:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 11:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 11:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 11:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 11:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 11:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 421">n</a>Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 11:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 423">p</a>the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 11:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 424">q</a>the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 425">r</a>turned unto the Lord.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 11:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 426">s</a>Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 11:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 427">t</a>exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 11:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 For he was a good man, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 428">u</a>full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 429">v</a>and much people was added unto the Lord.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 11:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 Then departed Barnabas to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 430">w</a>Tarsus, for to seek Saul:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 11:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch.

<div id="Acts 11:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 And in these days came <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 431">x</a>prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 11:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And there stood up one of them named <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 432">y</a>Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 11:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 433">z</a>relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 12:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And he killed James <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 435">a</a>the brother of John with the sword.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also.

<div id="Acts 12:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 437">c</a>when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And, behold, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 438">d</a>the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly.

<div id="Acts 12:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And he went out, and followed him; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 439">e</a>wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 440">f</a>he saw a vision.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 441">g</a>which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 442">h</a>the Lord hath sent his angel, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 443">i</a>hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And when he had considered the thing, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 444">j</a>he came to the house of Mary the mother of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 445">k</a>John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 446">l</a>praying.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 447">m</a>It is his angel.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 But he, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 448">n</a>beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 449">o</a>their country was nourished by the king's country.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And immediately the angel of the Lord <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 450">p</a>smote him, because <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 451">q</a>he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 12:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 But <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 452">r</a>the word of God grew and multiplied.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 15:38" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 587">j</a>who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 15:39" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;39 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 16:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 595">f</a>that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 16:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 598">i</a>man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 16:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 599">j</a>into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 16:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 16:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there.

<div id="Acts 16:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 603">n</a>possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 604">o</a>much gain by soothsaying:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 16:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 16:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And this did she many days. But Paul, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 605">p</a>being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 606">q</a>And he came out the same hour.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 16:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 610">u</a>do exceedingly trouble our city,  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 16:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 16:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 611">v</a>and commanded to beat them.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 16:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 17:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 624">e</a>Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 17:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 628">i</a>searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 17:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 17:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 19:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 674">b</a>We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 675">c</a>Unto John's baptism.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Then said Paul, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 676">d</a>John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 When they heard this, they were baptized <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 677">e</a>in the name of the Lord Jesus.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And when Paul had <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 678">f</a>laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 679">g</a>they spake with tongues, and prophesied.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And all the men were about twelve.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 680">h</a>And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 681">i</a>concerning the kingdom of God.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 But <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 682">j</a>when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 683">k</a>of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 684">l</a>this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 685">m</a>God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 19:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 689">q</a>fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And many that believed came, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 690">r</a>confessed, and shewed their deeds.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 691">s</a>So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 19:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 So he sent into Macedonia two of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 695">w</a>them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 696">x</a>Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 697">y</a>the same time there arose no small stir about <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 698">z</a>that way.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 699">a</a>no small gain unto the craftsmen;  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 700">b</a>they be no gods, which are made with hands:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 701">c</a>Gaius and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 702">d</a>Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 703">e</a>Alexander <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 704">f</a>beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:34" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:36" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;36 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:37" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;37 For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:38" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;38 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:39" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;39 But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:40" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;40 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 19:41" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;41 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20" class="chapters" >Chapter 20</div>
<div id="Acts 20:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 705">a</a>departed for to go into Macedonia.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And there abode three months. And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 706">b</a>when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 707">c</a>Aristarchus and Secundus; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 708">d</a>Gaius of Derbe, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 709">e</a>Timotheus; and of Asia, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 710">f</a>Tychicus and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 711">g</a>Trophimus.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 These going before tarried for us at Troas.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And we sailed away from Philippi after <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 712">h</a>the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 713">i</a>to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And upon <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 714">j</a>the first day of the week, when the disciples came together <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 715">k</a>to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And there were many lights <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 716">l</a>in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And Paul went down, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 717">m</a>fell on him, and embracing him said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 718">n</a>Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 20:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 719">o</a>for he hasted, if it were possible for him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 720">p</a>to be at Jerusalem <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 721">q</a>the day of Pentecost.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 22:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23" class="chapters" >Chapter 23</div>
<div id="Acts 23:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 818">a</a>I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 819">b</a>to smite him on the mouth.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 820">c</a>commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And they that stood by said, Re-vilest thou God's high priest?  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Then said Paul, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 821">d</a>I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 822">e</a>Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 823">f</a>I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 824">g</a>of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 825">h</a>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 826">i</a>We find no evil in this man: but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 827">j</a>if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 828">k</a>let us not fight against God.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 829">l</a>the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And when it was day, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 830">m</a>certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And he said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 831">n</a>The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And he wrote a letter after this manner:  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 23:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 23:34" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;34 And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was.

<div id="Acts 24:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 861">u</a>that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 25:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 25:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 Then <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 878">o</a>Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 25:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 879">p</a>all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 880">q</a>not to live any longer.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 25:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 But when I found that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 881">r</a>he had committed nothing worthy of death, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 882">s</a>and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 25:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 26:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 912">d</a>if he had not appealed unto Caesar.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 27:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 914">b</a>Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 915">c</a>courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 916">d</a>because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And the third day <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 917">e</a>we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 But after long abstinence, Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 27:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 920">h</a>for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 27:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.  </div></br>

<div id="Acts 27:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 923">k</a>gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:36" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:37" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;37 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 924">l</a>souls.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:38" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:39" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;39 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:40" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;40 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:41" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;41 And falling into a place where two seas met, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 925">m</a>they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:42" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;42 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:43" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;43 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 27:44" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;44 And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 926">n</a>that they escaped all safe to land.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28" class="chapters" >Chapter 28</div>
<div id="Acts 28:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And when they were escaped, then they knew that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 927">a</a>the island was called Melita.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 928">b</a>barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 929">c</a>felt no harm.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 930">d</a>said that he was a god.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 931">e</a>prayed, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 932">f</a>laid his hands on him, and healed him.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Who also honoured us with many <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 933">g</a>honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 934">h</a>Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 935">i</a>though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 936">j</a>was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Who, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 937">k</a>when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 But when the Jews spake against it, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 938">l</a>I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 939">m</a>for the hope of Israel I am bound with <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 940">n</a>this chain.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 941">o</a>it is spoken against.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 942">p</a>to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 943">q</a>both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 944">r</a>some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 Saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 945">s</a>Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 946">t</a>unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,  </div></br>
<div id="Acts 28:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Acts 947">u</a>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.  </div></br>
