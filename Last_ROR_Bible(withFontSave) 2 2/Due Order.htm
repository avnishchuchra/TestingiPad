<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>N</b></font>ot long after he began to
reign as King of Israel, David
organized the transportation of the
ark of God back to Jerusalem from
Judah. A new cart was made for its
transportation. They got the finest
oxen to pull the cart and two men
were stationed in it to ensure the ark
arrived in one good piece. But God
was displeased with the people
because their action wasn't according
to the prescribed order. God had
already said only the priests should
carry the ark, and they had to carry it
over their shoulders with the staves
attached to it (Exodus 25: 13-14; 1
Chronicles 15:15). So God was not
impressed with the new
and costly cart.
At a point during the
journey, the oxen stumbled
and the ark of God
shook and almost fell.
Then Uzzah, one of the
men in the cart, tried to
stop it from falling, which
was a good and kind act.
But he was struck by the
power of God and he
died because he tried to put his
hand on the ark. David wondered
what went wrong, and why Uzzah
was killed.
So he went and looked through
the scriptures and discovered they
had not done things God's way.
Several months later, he assembled
the people and got the priests to
carry the ark of God into Jerusalem
as they should have done, and God
blessed them.
There is a very important lesson
to learn in all of these. There is a
pattern laid out plainly in the Word
that God wants you to follow.
Whatever He tells you to do, He
wants you to do it according to the<em><strong> </strong></em>pattern found in His
Word. <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;For because ye
did it not at the first,
the LORD our God
made a breach upon
us, for that we sought
him not after<u> the due
order</u>&quot; (1 Chronicles 15:13).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
It matters how
you do what you do.
You can only do God's
things God's way to get
God's approval. There
is a prescribed manner,
and God will not alter
His standards to conform
with yours. You have to
line up with His prescribed
order.</p>
