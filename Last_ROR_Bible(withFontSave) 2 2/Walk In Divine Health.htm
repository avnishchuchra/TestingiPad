<p class="articles"><font size="+3">G</font>od's greatest wish is for you
to prosper and live in health.
That's why He didn't say &quot;Beloved, I
wish above all things that thou mayest
prosper and be healed...&quot; rather, He
said, &quot;that thou mayest prosper and
be in health.&quot; He's talking about you
living in divine health and not merely
getting healed. Healing is good, it's
the children's bread, but walking in
divine health is far better. When
you're living in divine health, you
don't need healing, because you
don't get sick.
To some people, this sounds
absurd, because they feel it's not
possible for someone to be perpetually
healthy. But that's the life
Jesus brought to us. That's
what His death, burial
and resurrection accomplished
for us. We've been
called to live a sicknessfree
and disease-free life.
As you grow in Christ, it's important
that you leave the good things for
the best. Thus, you ought to
transcend the level of needing
healing from God to living everyday
in divine health. This is the life of the
new creation in Christ Jesus; old
things (including sickness) have
passed away!
This is why the Bible says &quot;the
inhabitant shall not say, I am sick...&quot;
(Isaiah 33:24). The city the prophet
is referring to is Zion, the city of the
living God and you were born into
Zion the moment you were born
again (Hebrews 12:22-23). The reason
the citizens of Zion won't say they<em><strong> </strong></em>are sick isn't that they're
avoiding wrong confessions;
it's because they
don't get sick! They are
not &quot;sickable!&quot; <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Beloved, I wish
above all things that
thou mayest prosper
and be in health,
even as thy soul
prospereth&quot;
(3 John 1:2).</em></strong><br>
<br>
They are
the possessors of eternal
life, and that life destroys
sickness, repels disease,
and annuls infirmity.</p>
