<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>here's a difference between
the old &quot;you&quot; and the new
&quot;you&quot; after you received Christ. The
old &quot;you&quot; had the nature of sin,
therefore he sinned at will. However,
that old nature was crucified with
Christ! Right now, you're a brand
new person. This is because the new
creation has no past; he never existed
before. Hallelujah!
As far as God is concerned, your
past was buried with Jesus when He
died for us. Your past failures and
mistakes don't matter anymore. The
day you were born again became
the first day of your life. You can now
chart your course for victory and
success as you put the
principles of God's Word
to work.
God has already determined
a great future for
the new creation; He is
the God who declares
the end from the beginning and
&quot;makes all things new&quot; (Revelation
21:5). He has ordained everything in
your life to go in the path of success.
Refuse to judge yourself according
to your past mistakes and manner of
life, for &quot;if any man be in Christ, he is
a new creation: old things are passed
away; behold, all things are become
new!' God has made all things in
your life new; you're a brand new
species of being.
Refuse to allow the devil fill your
mind with thoughts and memories
of the sins you committed before
you were born again, for as far as
God is concerned, the handwriting<em><strong>  </strong></em>of sin concerning you
has been cancelled. <br>
<br>
<em> <strong>&quot;Therefore if any
man be in Christ, he
is a new creature:
old things are passed
away; behold, all
things are become
new&quot; (2 Corinthians 5:17).</strong></em>
<br>
<br>
A
new life of righteousness
and true holiness has
begun for you.
