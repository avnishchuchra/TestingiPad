<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Lord Jesus minced no words
when it came to salvation; He
said: <em>&quot;I am the way, the truth, and the
life: no man cometh unto the Father,
but by me&quot; </em>(John 14:6). He never
suggested that salvation could come
from any other means or through
anyone else but Him.
As a Christian, you must be
absolutely convinced that there's no
salvation in any other
name, except the Name
of Jesus. When it dawns
on your spirit that Jesus
is the only Name given
under heaven by which
men shall be saved, you'll
preach the gospel with
conviction. The Bible says<em> &quot;...if thou shalt confess
with thy mouth the Lord
Jesus, and shalt believe in
thine heart that God hath
raised him from the dead,
thou shalt be saved&quot;
(Romans 10:9). </em>This the
way to receive salvation
When the sinner confesses
with his mouth,
not all his sins, but the Lordship of
Jesus, and believes in his heart that
God raised Him from the dead, he's
immediately passed from death unto
life.
The Bible tells us of Cornelius, a
Roman centurion, a devout and
generous man, but he was not saved
(Acts 10:2). When the angel of God
appeared to him, he didn't say,<em><strong> </strong></em>&quot;Cornelius, your good
deeds outweigh your
bad deeds, so salvation
is yours&quot;; the angel had
to tell him to send for
Peter, who would tell
him words by which he
would be saved.
<br>
<br>
<em><strong> &quot;Be it known unto you
all, and to all the people of
Israel, that by the name of
Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
whom ye crucified, whom
God raised from the dead,
even by him doth this man
stand here before you
whole. This is the stone
which was set at nought
of you builders, which is
become the head of the
corner. Neither is there
salvation in any other:
for there is none other
name under heaven given
among men, whereby we
must be saved&quot; (Acts 4:10-12).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
So when you preach
the gospel, don't preach
apologetically. The whole
world needs to know
that Christ Jesus is the
only Name given to men
by which they must be
saved-that's the key to
their salvation.</p>
