AND A GLORIOUS NIGHT!</b></font></p>
 


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">A</font>s the day wears on and
evening comes, the sun sets
and the night is ushered in with
darkness. Nighttime could be a
period people dread for various
reasons. Fear of loneliness, fear of
not waking up the next day, a visit
from wicked and unreasonable men,
bad dreams, strange noises from
various corners, demonic oppressions,
fighting and scratching from some
unwholesome creatures ...e.t.c.
Nighttime could be lonely as the
city goes to sleep, silence covers the
land, help is scarce and reliance is
risky. But God actually divided light
from darkness and called the light
'Day' and the darkness
He called 'Night.' And
the Bible says God was
pleased with it (Genesis
1:3-5).
Now, this implies that
both your day and night
are blessed, fruitful and
abounding. But if you
make it a habit to be
frightened by darkness
and be uncomfortable at
night, you will live a life of struggle,
because day and night have come
to stay.
You may have had sleepless
nights for one reason or the other,
but make up your mind that your
nights will not be fraught with
sadness and despair. Don't make
plans on how to spend your day
only, consider that your night can
also be used productively. If you set
out concrete plans on how to spend
your night, even bad dreams and
demonic interferences would be
subdued.
Luke 6:12 tells us Jesus often
spent his nights in prayer. The<em><strong> </strong></em>Psalmist says the man is
blessed who delights in
the law of the Lord and
meditates in it day and
night (Psalm 1:2).
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Thou shalt not be
afraid for the terror
by night; nor for the
arrow that flieth by
day;&quot;(Psalm 91:5).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
Also Psalm 74:16 tells
us that day and night
belongs to God. If thats
true, it means they belong
to you too. So have a
blessed day and a glorious
night!</p>
