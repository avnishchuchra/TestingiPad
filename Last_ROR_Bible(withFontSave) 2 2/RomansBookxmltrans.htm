<div id="Romans 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 That is, that I may be comforted together with you by <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 21">u</a>the mutual faith both of you and me.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 22">v</a>was let hitherto,) that I might have some <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 23">w</a>fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 24">x</a>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.  </div></br>

<div id="Romans 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 25">y</a>I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 26">z</a>it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 27">a</a>to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 28">b</a>The just shall live by faith.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 29">c</a>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Because <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 30">d</a>that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 31">e</a>God hath shewed it unto them.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 32">f</a>the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 33">g</a>became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 1:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 34">h</a>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 1:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 35">i</a>God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.  </div></br>

Amen.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 1:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 For this cause God gave them up unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 41">o</a>vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 1:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 1:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 42">p</a>which are not convenient;  </div></br>

<div id="Romans 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Romans 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 44">a</a>for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Or despisest thou <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 45">b</a>the riches of his goodness and forbearance and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 46">c</a>longsuffering; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 47">d</a>not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 48">e</a>treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;  </div></br>

<div id="Romans 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:  </div></br>

<div id="Romans 7:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 182">a</a>the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.  </div></br>

<div id="Romans 7:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 184">c</a>dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 185">d</a>bring forth fruit unto God.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 186">e</a>to bring forth fruit unto death.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 187">f</a>in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 188">g</a>Thou shalt not covet.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.

<div id="Romans 7:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And the commandment, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 190">i</a>which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Wherefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 191">j</a>the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.  </div></br>

<div id="Romans 7:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 192">k</a>sold under sin.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 For that which I do I allow not: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 193">l</a>what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 For I know that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 194">m</a>in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 For I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 195">n</a>delight in the law of God after <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 196">o</a>the inward man:  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 But <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 197">p</a>I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 7:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?  </div></br>

<div id="Romans 8:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 200">b</a>the law of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 201">c</a>the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 8:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 202">d</a>what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 203">e</a>God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:  </div></br>

<div id="Romans 8:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 206">h</a>to be carnally minded is death: but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 8:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Because <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 207">i</a>the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 208">j</a>neither indeed can be.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 8:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 8:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 209">k</a>the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 210">l</a>the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 8:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.  </div></br>

<div id="Romans 8:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 8:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 213">o</a>if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 214">p</a>mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.  </div></br>

<div id="Romans 8:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 For we know that the whole creation <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 227">c</a>groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 8:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 228">d</a>the firstfruits of the Spirit, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 229">e</a>even we ourselves groan within ourselves, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 230">f</a>waiting for the adoption, to wit, the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 231">g</a>redemption of our body.  </div></br>
<div id="Romans 8:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 For we are saved by hope: but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Romans 232">h</a>hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?  </div></br>
