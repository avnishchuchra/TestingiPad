<div id="2 John 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And now I beseech thee, lady, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 John 5">e</a>not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 John 6">f</a>that we love one another.  </div></br>
<div id="2 John 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 John 7">g</a>this is love, that we walk after his commandments.

<div id="2 John 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 John 9">i</a>many deceivers are entered into the world, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 John 10">j</a>who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 John 11">k</a>This is a deceiver and an antichrist.  </div></br>
