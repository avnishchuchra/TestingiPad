<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>YOU CAME AT THE RIGHT TIME</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>T</b></font>he Bible records that a wicked
man by the name of Haman
whipped up a conspiracy to destroy
God's people who were in captivity.
Being the Prime Minister, he was
able to convince the king that it was
necessary to annihilate them. But by
this time, a young Jewish girl by the
name of Esther had been chosen as
the queen of the reigning king,
Ahasuerus.
When her uncle,
Mordecai heard about it,
he sent her the message
in that she had come into
the kingdom at this time
for the purpose of saving
God's people (Esther 4:13-
14.). At the risk of her life,
Esther took up the challenge
and Haman's plan
backfired. She proved
that she was born for
such a time in the history
of the Jews.
Just like Esther, you
were born for such a
time as this. That means
you came at the right
time. Years ago, as a teenager
walking with my little briefcase, I
would say over and over again, &quot;The
world needs me! I was born as the
answer to the cry of millions!&quot; I
knew that I came at the right time,
for this generation, and my life has
been programmed in that direction
ever since. There's a reason you
weren't born a century ago or a<em><strong> </strong></em>century from now; God
purposed and planned
that you would come in
this generation, to be
the answer to the
questions of people in
this generation.
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot; For if thou
altogether holdest
thy peace at this
time, then shall there
enlargement and
deliverance arise to
the Jews from another
place; but thou and
thy father's house
shall be destroyed:
and who knoweth
whether thou art come
to the kingdom for
such a time as this?&quot; (Esther 4:14).</em></strong><br>
<br>
You're not a mistake
on the scene. God knew
you were coming and
He prepared for you.
When you have this
kind of mentality, you'll
get out of the league of
complainers and failures.</p>
