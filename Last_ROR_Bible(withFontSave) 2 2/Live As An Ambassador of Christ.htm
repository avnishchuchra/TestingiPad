<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>LIVE AS AN AMBASSADOR OF CHRIST</b></font></p>


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">A</font>n ambassador is an official
envoy, especially a diplomatic
agent accredited to a foreign government
or one who is sovereign as the
resident representative of his own
government. Now, being the legal
representative of his country in a
foreign nation, all the resources he
needs to function: his accommodation,
equipment, finances, etc., are
fully provided by his government. He
is independent of the economic
situation of his host nation because
his home government takes care of
all his needs.
Now, the Word of God describes
us as &quot;ambassadors&quot; for Christ; we
are diplomats from heaven,
for we are citizens
of the beloved country
of Zion (Philippians 3:20;
Hebrews 12:22). Thus,
you're living in this world
as an ambassador of heaven, just
like an earthly ambassador lives in
the country of his posting. As a
heavenly ambassador, you're open
to enjoy all the wonderful privileges
of your heavenly Kingdom. If an
earthly nation would see to it that
her ambassadors had all their needs
and requirements supplied, how
much more you, an ambassador of
heaven and a child of the Most High
God!
Remember, you're a legal representative
of God's Kingdom here on
earth; therefore live as one. You're
not of this world; you're from above!
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Now then we are
ambassadors for
Christ, as though
God did beseech you
by us: we pray you in
Christ's stead, be ye
reconciled to God&quot; (2 Corinthians 5:20).</em></strong><br>
<br>
The Lord has called you and<em><strong> </strong></em>separated you from the
world. Refuse to toil and
struggle like the people
of the world, for you
belong in God's Kingdom.
You have a bloodbought
right to live the
good life.</p>
