<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>WORK THE WORD!</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>H</b></font>ave you ever been confronted
with a situation and you said
to yourself, &quot;Let me pray about this,&quot;
and the question &quot;What if it doesn't
work?&quot; tried to intimidate you? Do
you know that question has prevented
many from calling upon the Name of
the Lord Jesus in their trouble because
they weren't sure it would work?
The Bible says, <em>&quot;...let God be true,
but every man a liar...&quot;</em> (Romans 3:4). God has
said that His Word doesn't
have the ability to fail
(Isaiah 55:11). Therefore,
if the Word didn't seem
to work for you, then it
wasn't faith, for if it was,
it would have worked!
Therefore, if you speak
the Word today and it
doesn't seem to work,
speak it again tomorrow!
If it still looks as though
nothing is happening, don't
give up. Keep speaking
it, keep declaring God's
word; it doesn't fail!
God's Word always works, so if
it hasn't worked for you, it's not
because it doesn't work. There may
be something you should be doing
that you're not doing or something
you ought not to be doing that
you're doing.
Anything you want in this world
can be yours. It could be healing for
your body, finances for your business,<em><strong> </strong></em>peace in your family...whatever you need, you
can have when you stay
consistent with the Word.
<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;Blessed be the
LORD, that hath given
rest unto his people
Israel, according to all
that he promised:
there hath not failed
one word of all his
good promise, which
he promised by the
hand of Moses his
servant&quot; (1 Kings 8:56). </strong></em><br>
<br>
People listening to you
may think you're out of
your mind, but you know
what you want. So keep
speaking the Word; keep
working the Word and
have you heart's desires
met through faith in the
word!</p>
