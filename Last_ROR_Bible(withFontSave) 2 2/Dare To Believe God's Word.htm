<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>G</b></font>ideon lived at a time when
Israel was being oppressed
by her enemies. The Bible tells us
that an angel of the Lord met him
while he was about his work
diligently. The angel saluted him
saying, <em>&quot;...The LORD is with thee,
thou mighty man of valour..&quot;</em>(Judges
6:12). Gideon thought that statement
was a joke and he protested (Judges
6:13).
The Bible says, <em>&quot;And the LORD
looked upon him, and said, Go in this
thy might, and thou shalt save Israel
from the hand of the Midianites: have
not I sent thee?&quot; </em>(Judges 6:14). Gideon
couldn't believe his ears. You see,
he'd always thought he
was insignificant; the
lastborn of a poor family
of the weakest tribe in
Israel. How could he be a
mighty man of valour?
God, however , saw
beyond what he thought
of himself (Judges 6:16).
Thank God Gideon dared
to take God at His Word,
and God delivered Israel
through him.
Do you know that many of God's
people are like Gideon? It's as
though they're afraid to believe what
God has said about them. All the
time, they compare what they see in
the Word with their experiences,
and that's their trouble.
Dare to believe God's Word. Just
as He did to Gideon, God will always
bring His Word to you everyday. It's
your choice to be bold enough to
endorse it. So you see, your success
or failure in life is all up to you. The
moment you begin to declare what
the Word of God says about you, be
sure that the world and even spiritual<em><strong> </strong></em>babes will mock you.
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;And the angel of
the LORD appeared
unto him, and said
unto him, The
LORD is with thee,
thou mighty man of
valour&quot; (Judges 6:12).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
They'll say all sorts of
things against you; they'll
call you crazy or fanatic,
but don't cower! Don't
look at the circumstances
of your life to judge the
truth of what you see in
God's Word. Dare to
accept everything that
God has said about you.</p>
