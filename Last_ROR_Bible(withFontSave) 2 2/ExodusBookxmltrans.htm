<div id="Exodus 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 1">a</a>these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 2">b</a>seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 3">c</a>Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 4">d</a>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Now there <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 5">e</a>arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And he said unto his people, Behold, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 6">f</a>the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 7">g</a>Come on, let us <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 8">h</a>deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 9">i</a>to afflict them with their <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 10">j</a>burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 11">k</a>and Raamses.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And they <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 12">l</a>made their lives bitter with hard bondage, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 13">m</a>in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 But the midwives <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 14">n</a>feared God, and did not <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 15">o</a>as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 16">p</a>the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 17">q</a>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 18">r</a>that he made them houses.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 1:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 19">s</a>Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Exodus 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And there went a <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 20">a</a>man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 21">b</a>when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 22">c</a>And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 23">d</a>daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 24">e</a>her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And it came to pass in those days, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 25">f</a>when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 26">g</a>burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 27">h</a>slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 28">i</a>when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And he said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 29">j</a>Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 30">k</a>Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 31">l</a>a well.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 32">m</a>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 33">n</a>and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 34">o</a>watered their flock.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And when they came to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 35">p</a>Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 36">q</a>eat bread.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 37">r</a>Zipporah his daughter.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 38">s</a>Gershom: for he said, I have been <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 39">t</a>a stranger in a strange land.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And it came to pass <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 40">u</a>in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 41">v</a>sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 42">w</a>their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And God <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 43">x</a>heard their groaning, and God <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 44">y</a>remembered his <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 45">z</a>covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 2:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And God <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 46">a</a>looked upon the children of Israel, and God <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 47">b</a>had respect unto them.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 3" class="chapters" >Chapter 3</div>
<div id="Exodus 3:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 48">a</a>the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 49">b</a>the mountain of God, even to Horeb.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 50">c</a>the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 51">d</a>great sight, why the bush is not burnt.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 52">e</a>unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 3:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 53">f</a>put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 3:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Moreover he said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 54">g</a>I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 55">h</a>he was afraid to look upon God.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 3:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 56">i</a>have heard their cry <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 57">j</a>by reason of their taskmasters; for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 58">k</a>I know their sorrows;  </div></br>

<div id="Exodus 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Now therefore, behold, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 64">q</a>the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 65">r</a>oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 3:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 66">s</a>Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.  </div></br>

<div id="Exodus 3:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And he said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 68">u</a>Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 3:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?  </div></br>
<div id="Exodus 3:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Exodus 69">v</a>I AM hath sent me unto you.  </div></br>
