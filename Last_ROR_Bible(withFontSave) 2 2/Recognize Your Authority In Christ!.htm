<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>RECOGNIZE YOUR AUTHORITY <br>
IN CHRIST!</b></font></p>
<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he supernatural life available
to us as God's children isn't
just limited to spiritual things; it
extends to physical things also. Years
ago, my friends and I travelled to
many different places to preach. We
travelled during the day and at night
using an old vehicle which could
suddenly develop a fault in the
middle of nowhere. Each time this
happened, we never responded in
fear; rather we spoke to the car and
said, &quot;In the Name of Jesus Christ of
Nazareth, move!&quot; and it worked.
Though young in the faith, we
were able to prove that the Word
works! We recognized our authority
in Christ. When you find
yourself in an awkward
situation, the first thing
to do is not to react in
fear. Instead, recognize
your authority in Christ.
Remember that Jesus has
already given you power
over all the ability of the
enemy, therefore there's
nothing to be afraid of.
If a robber points a
gun to a Christian, for instance, and
says, &quot;Give me your car keys&quot; such
a fellow shouldn't become frantic,
fearful and intimidated. Rather, he
should ask himself, &quot;What does the
Holy Spirit want me to do in this
situation?&quot; because at that time,
that's what counts. For one, the
Spirit may say, &quot;Don't give him.<br>
&quot; 
For
another, He may say, &quot;Let him have
it.&quot; At that moment, what the Spirit
says is the most important. You may
be wondering, &quot;How can I tell what
the Spirit is saying?&quot; That's why you
ought to start speaking in tongues
immediately you find yourself in an
uncomfortable situation.<em><strong> <br>
<br>
&quot;Behold, I give
unto you power to
tread on serpents and
scorpions, and over
all the power of the
enemy: and nothing
shall by any means
hurt you&quot; (Luke 10:19).<br>
<br>
</strong></em>Speaking in tongues
will eliminate fear and
cause faith to well up in
your spirit, and you'll
find yourself declaring
God's Word that'll put
you over in that situation.
Refuse to fear. Recognize
that you're a victor in
Christ Jesus, and you have
authority over all the
power of the adversary.</p>
