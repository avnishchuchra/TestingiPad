<p class="articles"><font size="+3">M</font>an is a spirit; he lives in a
body and possesses a soul.
Unfortunately, there are people who
are more concerned about keeping
their body fit instead of paying the
most attention to exercising their
spirit unto godliness. The spirit is the
real man; no wonder we're
admonished in Scripture to exercise
ourselves rather unto godliness (1
Timothy 4:7).
God doesn't want you
to have a super-built body
and be flabby spiritually;
therefore, you must exercise
your spirit! You must
engage in spiritual exercise
which, unlike physical
exercise, has a promise
both for this life and for
the life to come. So the
question then is: how do
you exercise yourself
spiritually? It's simply by
engaging in spiritual activities
such as going to
church regularly, praying
in tongues consistently,
and studying God's Word
and sharing it with others.
There are Christians who don't
go to church regularly and that's not
right; the church is where you're
taught God's Word that builds your
spirit! It's the place where you can
participate in godly activities that'll
help you grow spiritually. Also, you
must not neglect to pray in other
tongues. Praying in other tongues is<em><strong> </strong></em>a great spiritual exercise;
it's the fastest way to
activate and energize
your spirit. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;But refuse profane
and old wives' fables,
and exercise thyself
rather unto godliness.
For bodily exercise
profiteth little: but
godliness is profitable
unto all things,
having promise of the
life that now is, and
of that which is to
come&quot; (1 Timothy 4:7-8).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
Train yourself
to pray often in other
tongues; apart from the
many other benefits it
has on your life, it will
open your heart to receive
and understand God's
Word.
Keep exercising yourself
unto godliness by
doing those things that
enhance your walk in
the divine life. As you do,
you'll also find yourself
dealing wisely.</p>
