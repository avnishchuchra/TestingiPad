<p class="articles"><font size="+3">A</font>s Christians, we're surrounded
by myriads of angels,
and the Bible says they are ministering
spirits sent to minister for us. That
means they're at our service even
though we don't see them with our
physical eyes. Some people are more
conscious of demons than they are
of angels and that's sad. The truth is
there're far more angels than demons,
which is why you must learn to
encourage the ministry of angels in
your life. In encouraging the ministry
of angels in your life, first you must
recognize that angels are real and
they're ever-present with you.
When I was just getting introduced
to their ministry years
ago, if I needed to be
woken up very early to
pray, I'd pray a simple
prayer, asking the Lord to
wake me. Sure enough,
I'd feel a tap on my arm
and as soon as I opened
my eyes, the clock would
read the exact time I
wanted to wake up. At
other times, I'd hear an
audible knock at my door at a time
when the whole house was fast
asleep. When I opened the door,
there'd be nobody there. The Lord
was introducing me to the ministry
of angels, and I've been conscious
of their presence with me ever
since.
As you act on the Word of God
and confess it rightly, you're encouraging
the ministry of angels in your
life. Angels help to bring to pass the
Word of God that you speak. When
you speak negative confessions of
doubt and unbelief, they can't act
on your behalf.
You also encourage the ministry of angels in your life
when you learn to be
subject to spiritual authority.

  <strong> <em>&quot;But to which of the
angels said he at any
time, Sit on my right
hand, until I make
thine enemies thy
footstool? Are they
not all ministering
spirits, sent forth to
minister for them
who shall be heirs of
salvation?&quot; (Hebrews 1:13-14). </em></strong><br>
<br>  
So stay in the Word
of God and make your
confessions of faith. When
you have supernatural
experiences like the
examples I gave, don't
dismiss them, God's angels are
working with you.</p>
