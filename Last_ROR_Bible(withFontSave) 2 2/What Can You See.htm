<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>WHAT CAN YOU SEE?</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>W</b></font>hat you see as God's Word
comes to you is very
important. If you can see yourself in
the Word coming to you, it'll surely
work for you. God said to Joshua,<em>&quot;...
See, I have given into thine hand
Jericho, and the King thereof, and the
mighty men of valour&quot; </em>(Joshua 6:2).
He had to see it first in order to
possess it. Again, when Abraham
separated from Lot, God
told him to look around
and said, <em>&quot;...all the land
which thou seest, to thee
will I give it...&quot; </em>(Genesis
13:15). The extent of his
vision was the boundary
of his blessing. It's the
same thing today!
What do you see when
the Word of the Lord
comes to you? What are
the thoughts that fill your
mind when you hear the
Word? Some think the
Word of God is too extravagant
and unrealistic, hence
they miss their blessing because they
didn't accept the Word. When your
heart is dominated by your senses,
it'll be very difficult to see the visions
of God as the Word comes to you.
This is why someone can come into
a church service and leave without
being affected by the Word. He's not
inspired in any way and has no
motivation whatsoever, because he<em><strong> </strong></em>didn't see anything. How
sad!
<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;And the LORD
said unto Joshua,
See, I have given into
thine hand Jericho,
and the king thereof,
and the mighty men
of valour&quot; (Joshua 6:2).</strong></em><br>
<br>
Every time you hear
God's Word that talks
about your succes s ,
prosperity, victory, divine
health, and so on, personalize
that Word and
start seeing yourself in
the reality of it. When
you do this consistently,
you'll discover that defeat,
failure, sickness and
poverty are driven far
from you. That's how I
live, and I recommend
that you do the same.</p>
