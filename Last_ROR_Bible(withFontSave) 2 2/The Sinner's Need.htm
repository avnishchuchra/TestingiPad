<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he natural man, even at his
best, is still a sinner because
he is not born again. When someone
is a sinner, what he needs is not
repentance but a new life in Christ
Jesus. A sinner is not someone who
has committed a sin. It's wrong to sin
but you're not a sinner because you
sinned! This may sound a little hard
for your theology but it's the truth.
Sin is not just an act; it's a nature!
You have to know that.
A man who is not born again is a
sinner no matter how morally upright
he may be. The nature of the first
Adam, which is the nature of the
devil, is passed on to every man
that's born into this
world. That nature is the
nature of sin. But God
says, 'a new heart and a
new spirit will I put within
you,' meaning the sin
nature is completely taken
out when you're born
again. 2 Corinthians 5:17
says, &quot;If any man be in
Christ, he is a new creature!&quot;
Until you're born again,
you remain a sinner, irrespective of
your high level of moral and social
decorum.
A sinner does not need forgiveness,
because you can only be
forgiven your acts of wrong. What a
sinner needs is remission of sins.
There's a great difference between
the two. It's only the man who is
born again that qualifies to receive
forgiveness of sin from God. A sinner
can't repent. To repent is to change
your mind or your way of thinking
and turn around from what you used
to do. What the sinner needs is a
recreation.
He's got to be born again, he<em><strong> </strong></em>needs a new life altogether.
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;A new heart also
will I give you, and
a new spirit will I
put within you: and
I will take away the
stony heart out of
your flesh, and I will
give you an heart of
flesh&quot; (Ezekiel 36:26).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
And that new life
is in Christ. It's pointless
to keep reminding a
sinner of his sins. He
already knows he's a
sinner; what he needs is
the cure for sin. Tell him
about the saving grace
of Jesus, point him to the
light because that's what
he needs!</p>
