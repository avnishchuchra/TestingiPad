TO WALK IN VICTORY</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he day you were born again,
you were born into the life of
total and continuous victory. Jesus'
death on the cross made you one
with God, and ushered you into the
transcendent life of victory. Some
folks believe life is full of &quot;ups and
downs,&quot; but that's because they're
not acquainted with the vital realities
of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As a
child of God, you're called to live
each day in victory over every
situation that you face. That's the
lifestyle of the believer.
Victory is your birthright, for God
has raised you up and made you to
sit together with Christ in heavenly
places (Ephesians 2:6).
You're seated with Christ
&quot;Far above all principality,
and power, and might,
and dominion, and every
name that is named, not
only in this world, but
also in that which is to
come&quot; (Ephesians 1:21). You're
seated far above (not near above)
the devil and the cronies of darkness,
and the negative forces of this world.
You've already overcome them!
Therefore, walk in the light of your
victory; let it be your present-hour
mentality that you are &quot;undefeatable!&quot;
You aren't going to start walking
in victory in the sweet by-and-by;
now is the time for you to walk in
victory over sin, the devil, sickness,
death and the circumstances of life.
As far as God is concerned, nothing
in this world could defeat you, for
&quot;...greater is he that is in you, than he

 
that is in the world&quot; (1
John 4:4). <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;Now thanks be
unto God, which
always causeth us to
triumph in Christ,
and maketh manifest
the savour of his
knowledge by us in
every place&quot; (2 Corinthians 2:14).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
This is your
hour to reign-this is your
time to manifest the victory
that Christ wrought
for you.</p>
