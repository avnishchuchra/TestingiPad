<div id="Ezra 3:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 47">r</a>But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:  </div></br>

<div id="Ezra 4:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 49">b</a>since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 4:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 50">c</a>Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 51">d</a>king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 4:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Then <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 52">e</a>the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,  </div></br>

<div id="Ezra 4:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dis-honour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;  </div></br>

<div id="Ezra 4:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 4:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.  </div></br>

<div id="Ezra 4:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 4:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.  </div></br>

<div id="Ezra 5:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 5:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 5:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 68">j</a>Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?  </div></br>

<div id="Ezra 9:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Since the days of our fathers have <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 161">n</a>we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 162">o</a>have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 163">p</a>confusion of face, as it is this day.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 9:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 164">q</a>lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.  </div></br>

<div id="Ezra 9:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 9:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 169">v</a>filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 9:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Now therefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 170">w</a>give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 171">x</a>nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 172">y</a>leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 9:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 173">z</a>hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 9:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Should we <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 174">a</a>again break thy commandments, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 175">b</a>join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 176">c</a>angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 9:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 O LORD God of Israel, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 177">d</a>thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 178">e</a>before thee <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 179">f</a>in our trespasses: for we cannot <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 180">g</a>stand before thee because of this.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10" class="chapters" >Chapter 10</div>
<div id="Ezra 10:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 181">a</a>when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 182">b</a>before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 183">c</a>trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Now therefore let us make a <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 184">d</a>covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 185">e</a>tremble at <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 186">f</a>the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 187">g</a>be of good courage, and do it.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 188">h</a>to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 189">i</a>did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 190">j</a>all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Now therefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 191">k</a>make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 192">l</a>separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 193">m</a>the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 194">n</a>Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And they <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 195">o</a>gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezra 196">p</a>guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezra 10:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.  </div></br>
