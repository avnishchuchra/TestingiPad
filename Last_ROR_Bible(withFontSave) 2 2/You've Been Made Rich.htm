<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>YOU'VE BEEN MADE RICH</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he gospel of Jesus Christ is a
gospel of substitution. The Lord
Jesus took your place that you might
take His place. He became the
embodiment of sin so that you might
be made righteous (2 Corinthians
5:21). He took upon Himself your
sickness, disease and infirmity that
you might be healthy and strong (1
Peter 2:24). 2 Corinthians 8:9 tells us
that He became poor, so that you,
through His poverty, might be made
rich. You've got to believe this
because it's all in the same transaction.
The Lord Jesus, according to the
gospel principle of substitution, was
made poor so that you might be
made rich.
There are those who
argue that His becoming
&quot;poor&quot; was spiritual, but
that doesn't measure up.
At no time did the Lord
Jesus ever become poor
spiritually, for He was the
Son of God.
In shedding His glory
and condescending to
this earthly realm, He
became poor to successfully translate
us into His realm of wealth.
That's why as a Christian, you're not
the poor trying to be rich; you're the
rich discovering your inheritance.
You were born into limitless wealth;
an inexhaustible inheritance has
been laid up for you.
God's idea is not to try and make
you rich, for if you're born again,
you've already been made rich. He
expects you now to reach out and
help the needy. Refuse to be counted
among the poor or the masses
because you're the rich child of a
rich God. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;For ye know the
grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ, that,
though he was rich,
yet for your sakes he
became poor, that ye
through his poverty
might be rich&quot; (2 Corinthians 8:9).<br>
</em></strong><br>
  He desires to see you
  enjoy the abundance that's been<em><strong> </strong></em>laid up for you in Christ,
  and the way to enjoy
  your inheritance is by
  sticking with the Word
  of God. The Word of God
  &quot;...is able to build you up,
  and to give you an
  inheritance among all them
  which are sanctified&quot; (Acts
20:32).</p>
