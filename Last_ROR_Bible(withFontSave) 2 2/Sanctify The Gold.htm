<p class="articles"><font size="+3">I</font>n Matthew 23:16-17, the Lord
Jesus shows us the relationship
between the temple and the gold. &quot;The
temple sanctifies the gold.&quot; We're
'the temple' of God (1 Corinthians
3:16) and 'the gold' in today's terms
would refer to money. This means
that as God's New Testament temple,
your responsibility is to sanctify (that
is, dedicate to God) the money that
comes to you. &quot;How do I
do that?&quot; you might want
to ask. I'll show you from
the scriptures.
The children of Israel
had been slaves in Egypt
for hundreds of years.
But after God wrought
mighty miracles in the
land through Moses, the
Egyptians gave them all
their gold, silver, clothes,
etc, and begged them to
leave. As the children of
Israel journeyed through
the wilderness, God told
them to use all the treasures
they gathered from Egypt
to build a sanctuary for
Him (Exodus 25:1-8).
God caused the wealth of Egypt
to be transferred into the hands of
His people. His people in turn used
this wealth to build a sanctuary for
Him. In the same way today, God
puts His children in positions where
money can get into their hands to
use in accomplishing His plans and
purposes on earth. So you see, the<em><strong> </strong></em>reason you're in that job
or business is to sanctify
the money that comes
to you.
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Woe unto you, ye
blind guides, which
say, Whosoever shall
swear by the temple,
it is nothing; but
whosoever shall swear
by the gold of the
temple, he is a debtor!
Ye fools and blind:
for whether is greater,
the gold, or the temple
that sanctifieth the
gold?&quot; (Matthew 23:16-17).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
Each time you put
money into the things
of God, the work of the
ministry progresses, more
souls are won to Christ
and the Church expands
throughout the world.
That way, you're helping
to build a habitation of
God through the Spirit.
God on His part ensures
bigger doors of blessings
are opened for you to
function more effectively
in His Kingdom and in
the affairs of men.</p>
