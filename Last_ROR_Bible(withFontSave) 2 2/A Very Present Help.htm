<p class="articles"><font size="+3">G</font>od is great, yet He is our
friend and we can talk to
Him as our companion. It's a relief to
know that I'm never alone, not even
for one moment! The Lord Jesus has
already told us that in the last days
<em>&quot;...there shall be signs in the sun, and
in the moon, and in the stars; and
upon the earth distress of nations,
with perplexity; the sea and the waves
roaring'</em> (Luke 21:25). These are the
pictures we see in the news on
television, hear on radio and read in
the newspapers daily. As Christians,
irrespective of how vivid these
pictures might be, they're not our
portion.
You must look away
from all other things unto
Jesus (Hebrews 12:2). If
you observe the wind
and the waves like Peter
did, you'll most definitely
sink (Matthew 14:26-31). The Bible
says <em>&quot;Thou shalt not be afraid for the
terror by night; nor for the arrow that
flieth by day; Nor for the pestilence
that walketh in darkness; nor for the
destruction that wasteth at noonday.
A thousand shall fall at thy side, and
ten thousand at thy right hand; but it
shall not come nigh thee. Only with
thine eyes shalt thou behold and see
the reward of the wicked&quot; </em>(Psalm
91:5-8). So you see, those negative
reports you see, hear and read
wouldn't come near your home,
family or business as you remain in
the Word of God.

<em><strong>&quot;God is our refuge
and strength, a very
present in trouble' (Psalm 46:1).</strong></em><br>
<br>
Focus on good things and refuse<em><strong> </strong></em>to be moved by the
devil's report because
God is your refuge and
strength, a tested help
in times of trouble
(Psalm 46:1).</p>
