NAME OF JESUS!</b></font></p>


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Bible tells us that Peter and
John encountered a man who
was lame from birth at the gate of
the temple called Beautiful. Subsequently,
when Peter said to the man,
&quot;<em>In the Name of Jesus Christ of
Nazareth, rise up and walk,&quot;</em> life
came into those dead limbs and the
man leaped and walked! If Peter had
shouted, &quot;In the name of Caesar, rise
up and walk!&quot; nothing
would have happened. If
he had yelled as loud as
he could, &quot;In the name of
Pontius Pilate rise up and
walk,&quot;nothing would
have happened either. It
had to be &quot;In the Name of
Jesus,&quot; for that's the Name
above every name; that's
the Name that unlocks
every door!
No matter the critical
situation in which you've
found yourself, you can
use the Name of Jesus to
effect a change. It may
be impossible for you on
your own to get out of
that negative situation, just like the
crippled man at the gate couldn't
walk by his own ability, but through
the power in the Name of Jesus, you
can walk out of any trouble. All you
need do is call that Name in faith
and you'll walk out of poverty,
sickness, disease, depression and
failure.
The Name of Jesus is the Name<em><strong> </strong></em>you can trust; it's the
Name that never fails! By
the power of that Name,
I prophesy to you today:
you're walking out of
that difficulty. <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;Then Peter said,
Silver and gold have
I none; but such as I
have give I thee: In
the name of Jesus
Christ of Nazareth
rise up and walk.
And he took him by
the right hand, and
lifted him up: and
immediately his feet
and ankle bones
received strength. And
he leaping up stood,
and walked, and
entered with them into
the temple, walking,
and leaping, and
praising God&quot; (Acts 3:6-8).</strong></em><br>
<br>
If you've
been sick, I pronounce
you healed! If you
couldn't walk, begin to
walk! I declare success,
promotion, increase and
prosperity for you in the
mighty Name of Jesus!
Whatever you couldn't
do before, do it now, in
the all-powerful Name
of Jesus!</p>
