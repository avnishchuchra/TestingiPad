<p class="articles"><font size="+3">H</font>ave you ever wondered why
God rejected Cain’s offering
and accepted Abel’s? It wasn’t that
He preferred beef to vegetables. The
reason is much deeper than the
actual gifts the two brothers brought
before the Lord. The key to understanding
the Lord’s action is to know
the kind of offering the Lord required
of them.
On this occasion, the
sacrifice the Lord asked of
them was a "sin offering."
The sin offering always
required the shedding of
blood—animal blood. The
Apostle Paul also tells us in
the New Testament that
without the shedding of
blood there’s no remission
of sins (Hebrews 9:22).
So you couldn’t bring
crops from your farm as
a sin offering, even if they
were the best crops
around. But that was what
Cain did! He brought his
crops for a sin sacrifice
and God rejected it. 
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;… Cain brought
of the fruit of the
ground an offering
unto the LORD. And
Abel … brought of the
firstlings of his flock
and of the fat thereof.
And the LORD had
respect unto Abel and
to his offering: But
unto Cain and to his
offering he had not
respect...&quot;
(Genesis 4:3-5).</em></strong>
<br>
<br>


God being merciful still showed him the
right thing to do (Genesis 4:7). But
cain wouldn’t do the right thing.
Cain was offended because his
sacrifice was rejected and his brother’s
accepted, and he went out from
God’s presence with an evil heart.
It’s important that you serve God
with knowledge; get to know what He
wants so your service in the Kingdom
will be an offering of a
sweet savour before the
Lord. What is it you’re
bringing before the Lord
today? Is it your body,
your money, your prayers
or your service in His
house? Don’t offer Him
what He wouldn’t accept.
Find out what He wants
you to do and do it, so
your services and offerings
will be acceptable to
Him.
