<div id="Hebrews 1" class="chapters" >Chapter 1</div>
<div id="Hebrews 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 God, who at sundry times and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 1">a</a>in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Hath <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 2">b</a>in these last days <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 3">c</a>spoken unto us by his Son, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 4">d</a>whom he hath appointed heir of all things, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 5">e</a>by whom also he made the worlds;  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 6">f</a>Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 7">g</a>upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 8">h</a>sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Being made so much better than the angels, as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 9">i</a>he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 10">j</a>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 11">k</a>I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And again, when he bringeth in <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 12">l</a>the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 13">m</a>And let all the angels of God worship him.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And of the angels he saith, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 14">n</a>Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 But unto the Son he saith, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 15">o</a>Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 16">p</a>hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 17">q</a>Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 18">r</a>They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 But to which of the angels said he at any time, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 19">s</a>Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 20">t</a>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 21">u</a>heirs of salvation?  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Hebrews 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 For if the word <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 22">a</a>spoken by angels was stedfast, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 23">b</a>every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 24">c</a>which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 25">d</a>confirmed unto us by them that heard him;  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 26">e</a>God also bearing them witness, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 27">f</a>both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 28">g</a>gifts of the Holy Ghost, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 29">h</a>according to his own will?  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 30">i</a>the world to come, whereof we speak.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 But one in a certain place testified, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 31">j</a>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 32">k</a>Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 33">l</a>we see not yet all things put under him.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 But we see Jesus, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 34">m</a>who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 35">n</a>crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 36">o</a>for every man.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 37">p</a>For it became him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 38">q</a>for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 39">r</a>the captain of their salvation <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 40">s</a>perfect through sufferings.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 41">t</a>are all of one: for which cause <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 42">u</a>he is not ashamed to call them brethren,  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 43">v</a>I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And again, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 44">w</a>I will put my trust in him. And again, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 45">x</a>Behold I and the children <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 46">y</a>which God hath given me.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 47">z</a>also himself likewise took part of the same; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 48">a</a>that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And deliver them who <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 49">b</a>through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 50">c</a>to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3" class="chapters" >Chapter 3</div>
<div id="Hebrews 3:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 51">a</a>the heavenly calling, consider <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 52">b</a>the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 53">c</a>Moses was faithful in all his house.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 54">d</a>he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 For every house is builded by some man; but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 55">e</a>he that built all things is God.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 56">f</a>a servant, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 57">g</a>for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 But Christ as a son over his own house; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 58">h</a>whose house are we, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 59">i</a>if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Wherefore (as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 60">j</a>the Holy Ghost saith, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 61">k</a>To day if ye will hear his voice,  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 62">l</a>For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 63">m</a>whose carcases fell in the wilderness?  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And onto whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 3:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 4" class="chapters" >Chapter 4</div>
<div id="Hebrews 4:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.  </div></br>

<div id="Hebrews 4:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 4:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 64">a</a>As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 4:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 65">b</a>And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 4:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 4:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 4:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 66">c</a>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 4:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 4:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 4:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 4:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 4:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 For the word of God is <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 67">d</a>quick, and powerful, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 68">e</a>sharper than any <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 69">f</a>twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 70">g</a>a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 4:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 71">h</a>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 72">i</a>and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 4:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 4:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 73">j</a>we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 74">k</a>was in all points tempted like as we are, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 75">l</a>yet without sin.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 4:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 76">m</a>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 5" class="chapters" >Chapter 5</div>
<div id="Hebrews 5:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 5:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.  </div></br>

<div id="Hebrews 6:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 109">q</a>he sware by himself,  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 6:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 6:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 6:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 For men verily swear by the greater: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 110">r</a>an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 6:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 111">s</a>the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 6:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 6:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 112">t</a>and which entereth into that within the veil;  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 6:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7" class="chapters" >Chapter 7</div>
<div id="Hebrews 7:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 For this <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 113">a</a>Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Now consider how great this man was, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 114">b</a>unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And verily <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 115">c</a>they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 116">d</a>and blessed <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 117">e</a>him that had the promises.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes in Abraham.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 118">f</a>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 For it is evident that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 119">g</a>our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 For he testifieth, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 120">h</a>Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 121">i</a>the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 122">j</a>the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 123">k</a>draw nigh unto God.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 124">l</a>The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 125">m</a>to make intercession for them.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 126">n</a>and made higher than the heavens;  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 127">o</a>first for his own sins, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 128">p</a>and then for the people's: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 129">q</a>this he did once, when he offered up himself.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 7:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 8" class="chapters" >Chapter 8</div>
<div id="Hebrews 8:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 130">a</a>who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 8:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 8:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 131">b</a>it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 8:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 8:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Who serve unto the example and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 132">c</a>shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 133">d</a>for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 8:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 But now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 134">e</a>hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 8:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 8:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 For finding fault with them, he saith, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 135">f</a>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:  </div></br>

<div id="Hebrews 8:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 136">g</a>I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:  </div></br>

<div id="Hebrews 8:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 138">i</a>and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.  </div></br>
<div id="Hebrews 8:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Hebrews 139">j</a>In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old.
