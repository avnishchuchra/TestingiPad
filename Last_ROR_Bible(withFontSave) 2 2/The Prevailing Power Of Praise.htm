<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>THE PREVAILING POWER OF PRAISE</b></font></p>
  
<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>I</b></font>n quoting part of a Psalm of
David, Jesus said in Matthew
21:16, <em>&quot;have ye never read, Out of the
mouth of babes and sucklings thou
hast perfected praise?&quot; </em>But the Psalmist
actually said, &quot;out of the mouth of
babes thou has ordained strength.&quot;
In other words, Jesus connects praise
with strength. There's such an awesome
power that's released when you
begin to praise God. If you want to
continuously see the power and glory
of God in your life, you must learn to
praise God lavishly.
I'm not just talking about praising
Him when everything is going smoothly
with your job, family, business,
ministry, academics or
finances. I'm talking about
maintaining a lifestyle of
praise and thanksgiving
unto God, irrespective and
independent of circumstances.
Such praise creates
a force-field of God's
power in and around you,
causing circumstances,
devils, sicknesses, diseases
and everything that's not
consistent with the will of God to be
completely repelled from your life.
The Bible says the joy of the Lord
is your strength (Nehemiah 8:10).
That's what the Psalmist is saying.
Strength there refers to power; and
that power is what stills the enemy
and the avenger. When you praise
God by openly declaring His
majesty, the works of the enemy are
completely exterminated from your
life. One of the Hebrew synonyms
for the phrase <em>&quot;</em>still the enemy<em>&quot;</em> as
used in Psalm 8:2 is &quot;to destroy the
enemy&quot; or &quot;to paralyze the enemy.&quot;<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;Out of the mouth of
babes and sucklings
hast thou ordained
strength because of
thine enemies, that
thou mightest still
the enemy and the
avenger&quot; (Psalm 8:2).</strong></em><br>
<br>
This means that the praise of<em><strong> </strong></em>God that proceeds out
  of your mouth is a deathblow
  to the enemy.
  Never allow the praise
  of God depart from your
  lips. It creates a forcefield
  of God's power that
repels the enemy.</p>
