<b>PASTOR CHRIS</b>

<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>YOUR SET TIME <br>
TO IMPROVE YOUR WORLD!</b></font></p>


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">A</font>s a child of God, you ought
to always think of what you
can do to make the world a better
place. Success is making the world
around you better than you met it.
The world needs visionaries: men
and women who will step out from
the crowd, find a need, and reach
out to meet that need. One of the
principles of success is to be
challenged to make things better
than the way you met them. Instead
of being the one asking for help and
waiting for others to give to you, you
should become the helper! Become
the one to meet other people's needs.
Be the blesser and the giver, for that's
your calling. Always, ask
yourself, &quot;What can I do to
help?&quot; &quot;How can I contribute
to the development
of my world?&quot; That's the
mentality of a champion!
The Bible shows us
that Joseph stood out in
his day and saved the
entire nation of Egypt
from starvation during a
time of famine (Genesis
41:55-57). He didn't complain about
the famine; he did something about
it. This is your season; this is your
hour; this is your set time to make a
difference in your world. The world
ought to be a better place because
you came.
Thus, beginning with your sphere
of contact, do something to improve
your world. It begins with being
passionate for a God-idea and
having the courage to implement
that idea once you receive it. It
doesn't matter how small the idea
may seem, once you have it, run
with it. Before long, God will expand
your vision and increase your<em><strong> </strong></em> inspiration! <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;Ye are the light
of the world. A city
that is set on an hill
cannot be hid&quot; (Matthew 5:14)</strong></em>.<br>
<br>
He will grant
you the motivation and
the ability to conceive
and execute more ideas
that'll impact the world
and make it a better
place.
God brought you into
this world so that through
you, He'll touch others
with His love and power.</p>
