<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>FRUITFUL IN ALL SEASONS</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>T</b></font>he Lord has made you a tree
planted by the rivers of water,
and now you bring forth fruit in every
season; your leaf also shall not wither
and you prosper in everything you
do. There is something about you
that initiates productivity. When all
hope seems lost, the power of God
starts to bubble inside you and the
desired change is effected. You know
the time to pray more, you know
when to stir yourself up from within
by the Holy Spirit.
God has fashioned you in such a
way that you'll blossom in winter,
spring, autumn and summer; you'll
not know dry seasons. You're unperturbed
during the &quot;winter
of life&quot; for you know what
to do. You were made to
be productive in all
seasons. You were born
for all seasons.
  <em>&quot;And I will make thee
exceeding fruitful, and I
will make nations of thee,
and kings shall come out
of thee&quot;</em> (Genesis 17:6).
This Scripture was once a
promise the Lord made to Abraham
but is now fulfilled in you through
Christ Jesus. So you see, God has
invested so much in you because
He delights in you. It's time to burst
forth, blossom and bring out your
beautiful flower.
Joshua and Caleb refused to
observe their situation like ordinary
men, for they were covenantminded.
Thus, when others saw the
giants as stumbling blocks, they saw
them as bread. You were made to
triumph in every circumstance, so
don't let the devil deceive you. The
seed of God is in you, and it's a seed
of fruitfulness and productivity.<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;And he shall be
like a tree planted
by the rivers of
water, that bringeth
forth his fruit in his
season; his leaf also
shall not wither; and
whatsoever he doeth
shall prosper&quot; (Psalm 1:3).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
Yes,that problem is bread for
you because you were
born for all seasons.
Hallelujah!</p>
