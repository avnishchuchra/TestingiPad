<p class="articles"><font size="+3">I</font>n life, you must never compare
yourself with others; rather, run
your own race and be the best of
you. The Bible talks about &quot;the race&quot;
that is set before you. Hence, it's
needless to engage in any kind of
unhealthy rivalry or competition with
others. You're only permitted to
compete with yourself and outdo
your past. Never allow yourself to be
discouraged when it seems as though
those around you are making more
progress than you are.
That someone else is succeeding
doesn't mean you're failing: it all
depends on individual aims and
targets, or set objectives. Always
remember that you're not
running the same race.
Success is relative and is
measured at different
stages. For example, two
men are building their
houses; one lays a not too-
deep foundation and
starts erecting a bungalow,
while the other one takes
his time to dig deep
because he wants to erect
a five-storey building. The former
may finish his building and even start
living in it while the latter is yet
digging his foundation.
These two men aren't aiming for
the same thing. The fellow who
spent a long time digging knows his
foundation has to be deep enough
to accommodate the tall building he
intends to put up, for the higher you
want to build, the deeper your
foundation ought to be.
At the end of the day, when both
houses are built, the difference will
be clear between the two buildings.
If the fellow building the storeyed
house had gotten into unhealthy<em><strong> </strong></em>competition and became
discouraged that the
other fellow had already
moved into his house
while he was still digging
his foundation, he would
never have completed
his own masterpiece. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Brethren, I count
not myself to have
apprehended: but
this one thing I do,
forgetting those things
which are behind, and
reaching forth unto
those things which
are before&quot; (Philippians 3:13).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
So
in life, focus on your
race! Set your gaze upon
the Master and run your
race to win, seeking only
to outdo your past.</p>
