<p class="articles"><font size="+2">L</font>ife is meant to be joyful,
exciting and free! That's the
way God planned it, in spite of what
obtains in the lives of many people.
But those in the world don't have the
faintest idea what life really is. They
devise different means to finding
lasting satisfaction, only to discover
the void in their lives are even deeper
than they imagined. In their failure,
they live empty lives and become
unstable physically and emotionally.
There's more to life than the
glamour and glitz of Hollywood.
There's more to life than the glory of
winning a gold medal at the Olympic
games. There's more to life than the
FIFA world cup or any
other world series. There's
much more to life than
anything this world could
offer, because true life is
in Christ!
Christianity is the
revelation of the divine
life in a human person.
This is why the Christian
life is an exciting and
joyous life. It's a life full of the glory
of God. This life is lived in lovepower,
the greatest power in the
universe. It may not be exciting in
the eyes of the world, but it's the
best life there is nonetheless. The
world can't understand why we
always have smiles on our faces
amidst the toughest opposition.
They can't comprehend the source
of our joy amidst persecution. And
our prosperity in much adversity is a
mystery to them.
The book of Acts reveals that
God's people in the early Church
were exciting people. They were
joyful even in times of great<em><strong> </strong></em>persecution. <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;And my soul
shall be joyful in the
LORD: it shall rejoice
in his salvation&quot;
(Psalm 35:9).</strong></em> <br>
<br>
They must
have been glorious to
behold. Refuse to live a
life of misery; stir up
excitement in your spirit
by spending more time
praying in the Spirit and
studying your Bible. Do
this until you're full of
joy in the Holy Ghost;
that's Christianity!</p>
