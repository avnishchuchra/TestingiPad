<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>NO MORE SICKNESS!</b></font></p>



<p class="articles"><font size="+3">W</font>hen the prophet Isaiah said,
&quot;the inhabitant shall not say
I am sick&quot; (Isaiah 33:24), he was
talking about the inhabitant of Zion-
the new creation in Christ Jesus.
Throughout the New Testament,
God's Word clearly shows us that
every form of sickness has no place
in the new creation. The Apostle
James in his epistle said <em>&quot;Is any sick
among you? let him call for the elders
of the church; and let them pray over
him...&quot; </em>(James 5:14). Notice he didn't
say, &quot;Those of us that are sick, should
call for the elders of the church...&quot;
because the new creation is not
subject to sickness, disease or the
devil.
Some Christians crave
sympathy so much that
they attribute all sorts of
diseases to their bodies.
This is quite sad, because
they're walking contrary
to the Word of God. Soon
enough, the devil afflicts
them with the backache,
headache or stomach
ulcer they've always said
they had. Some others base their
lives on how they feel. Once they
feel a headache, they say, &quot;I have a
fever.&quot; They always voice out their
feelings. But 1 Peter 2:24 says, <em>&quot;Who
his own self (Jesus) bare our sins in
his own body on the tree, that we,
being dead to sins, should live unto
righteousness: by whose stripes ye
were healed.&quot; </em>If you were healed then, you're
still healed now. So you see, the
new creation isn't supposed to be
sick! If you couldn't walk, and you're
born again and filled with the Holy
Ghost, say, &quot;I walk in the Name of
Jesus,&quot; then get up and start walking.<em><strong> <br>
<br>
<em> &quot;And the inhabitant
shall not say, I am
sick: the people that
dwell therein shall
be forgiven their
iniquity&quot;
(Isaiah 33:24).</em><br>
<br>
</strong></em>Don't &quot;try&quot; to get up, just
get up! The person who
is healed doesn't try to
stand up, he just stands
up!
God has ordained us
to live the supernatural
life naturally; therefore no
more sickness and disease.
Sickness with its
attendant effects are
gone with the old nature.</p>
