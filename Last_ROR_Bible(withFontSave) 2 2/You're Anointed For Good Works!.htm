<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>YOU'RE ANOINTED FOR <br>
GOOD WORKS!</b></font></p>


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">P</font>rior to His baptism by John
at the River Jordan, where
the Holy Ghost descended on
Jesus, there was no record of Him
performing any miracles. It was after
He received the Holy Spirit that He
went about doing good, healing all
that were oppressed of the devil
(Acts 10:38). John wrote that if all
the miracles Jesus did were to be
chronicled in books, even the world
itself would not contain the books
that would be written (John 21:25).
The Lord Jesus was anointed by the
Holy Spirit for good works; thus, His
life was an unending stream of the
miraculous.
Now, for us who are
born again, we've been
anointed by the same
Holy Spirit for good
works. The Bible lets us
know that the same Spirit
that raised Jesus from the
dead lives in us today
(Romans 8:11); that
same Spirit vitalizes and
energizes us for good
works. No wonder we're
described in Scripture as peculiar
people, zealous and empowered for
good works (Titus 2:14).
The anointing for the miraculous
came into your life when you received
the Holy Spirit. This is why in
Matthew 10:8, the Master instructs
that you <em>&quot;heal the sick, cleanse the
lepers, raise the dead, and cast out
devils.&quot;</em> Like Jesus, you've been
anointed for good works; in your
sphere of contact, you ought to
be doing good, healing all that are
oppressed of the devil, for God is
with you.
What you need in your life is
the Holy Spirit, and the day-to-day


  <strong>  <em>&quot;</em></strong> consciousness of His
indwelling presence. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>How God anointed
Jesus of Nazareth
with the Holy Ghost
and with power: who
went about doing
good, and healing all
that were oppressed of
the devil; for God was
with him&quot;
(Acts 10:38).</em></strong><br>
<br>
He
is the Miracle Worker,
the power of God, and
He has filled you with
His miracle working
ability (John 14:12).</p>
