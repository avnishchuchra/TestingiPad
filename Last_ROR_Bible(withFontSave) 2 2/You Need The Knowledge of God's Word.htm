<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>YOU NEED THE KNOWLEDGE OF<br> 
GOD'S WORD</b></font></p>

<P class="articles"><font size="+3">W</font>hen you buy a new electrical
appliance, the first
thing you ought to do is read the
instruction manual in order to be
informed on the proper use of the
appliance. With this information, you're
placed in a position of advantage as
you'll be able to use that appliance
properly. If, however, you're ignorant
of how the appliance works, you'll
not be able to use it to its maximum
capacity. In the same vein, when you
don't have knowledge of God's Word,
you'll not be able to live in dominion
and victory over sickness, poverty
and the devil because you'll be
ignorant of who you are, what you
have and your rights in
Christ.
Proverbs 11:9 says, <em>&quot;...through knowledge shall
the just be delivered.&quot;</em> This scripture isn't referring
to being delivered
from the devil; it's talking about
being delivered into your inheritance.
Through the knowledge of God's
Word, a Christian can live in
dominion and victory over circumstances
and situations; knowledge
makes the Christian a freeman. In
other words, knowledge is the key
to your freedom.
You have to realize it's only the
knowledge of God's Word that'll
move you forward in life. It'll instill in
you the mentality of one who reigns
and overcomes the world and its
systems; the victor's mentality. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;My people are
destroyed for lack
of knowledge...&quot; (Hosea 4:6).</em></strong><br>
<br>
There
is no need to live a defeated life; it's
unnecessary. Make up your mind<em><strong> </strong></em>today to learn God's
Word. Don't be a prisoner
of ignorance, rather, live
in the freedom of knowledge.</P>
