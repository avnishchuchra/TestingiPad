GOD'S BLESSING</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+3">I</font>sn't it wonderful to know that
the fullness of God's blessings
belong to you? It's your set time to
experience the bountiful blessings of
God in overflowing measure. Somebody
said, &quot;I've been praying to God
to bless me.&quot; That's the wrong prayer.
God isn't going to bless you any
more than He already did. He already
blessed you with ALL spiritual blessings
in heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
not some.
The question now is: Are you in
Christ? For that's where the blessings
are-in Christ. So if you're in Christ,
you don't need to look for any
blessing anywhere else, or pray to
God to bless you. Simply
recognize that it's your
set time to enjoy the
fullness of God's blessings.
The Bible says you were
called to inherit a blessing
(1 Peter 3:9); you were
born into the blessing because
you're the seed of Abraham. The
Lord told Abraham, &quot;I will bless you
and make you a blessing&quot; (Genesis
12:2). This promise was to Abraham
and his seed (Galatians 3:16), which
means not only are you blessed, you
are also a blessing.
Make up your mind to live up to
your calling. You're full of the
blessings of God. There's no blessing
in this world or in heaven that you
should be asking God for, because
all things are yours (1 Corinthians
3:21). You ought to be basking in
superabundance! Your life should
be filled with the good things of<em><strong> </strong></em>life in an overflowing
measure, so that others
who come in contact
with you can partake of
the goodness of God in
your life. <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;Blessed be the God
and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ,
who hath blessed
us with all spiritual
blessings in heavenly
places in Christ&quot;
(Ephesians 1:3).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
This is the set
time for that to happen.</p>
