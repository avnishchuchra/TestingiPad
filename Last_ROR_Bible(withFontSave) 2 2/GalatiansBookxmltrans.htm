<div id="Galatians 1" class="chapters" >Chapter 1</div>
<div id="Galatians 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 1">a</a>by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 2">b</a>who raised him from the dead;)  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And all the brethren <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 3">c</a>which are with me, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 4">d</a>unto the churches of Galatia:  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 5">e</a>Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 6">f</a>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 7">g</a>from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 8">h</a>Which is not another; but there be some <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 9">i</a>that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 But though <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 10">j</a>we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 11">k</a>than that ye have received, let him be accursed.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 12">l</a>do I now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 13">m</a>persuade men, or God? or <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 14">n</a>do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 15">o</a>But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 16">p</a>I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 17">q</a>by the revelation of Jesus Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 18">r</a>beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 19">s</a>wasted it:  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 20">t</a>being more exceedingly zealous <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 21">u</a>of the traditions of my fathers.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 But when it pleased God, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 22">v</a>who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 23">w</a>To reveal his Son in me, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 24">x</a>I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 25">y</a>flesh and blood:  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Then after three years <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 26">z</a>I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 But <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 27">a</a>other of the apostles saw I none, save <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 28">b</a>James the Lord's brother.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Now the things which I write unto you, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 29">c</a>behold, before God, I lie not.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 30">d</a>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And was unknown by face <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 31">e</a>unto the churches of Judaea which <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 32">f</a>were in Christ:  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 1:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And they glorified God in me.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Galatians 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Then fourteen years after <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 33">a</a>I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And I went up by revelation, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 34">b</a>and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 35">c</a>I should run, or had run, in vain.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And that because of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 36">d</a>false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 37">e</a>that they might bring us into bondage:  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 38">f</a>God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 39">g</a>in conference added nothing to me:  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 But contrariwise, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 40">h</a>when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 41">i</a>was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 42">j</a>the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 43">k</a>pillars, perceived <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 44">l</a>the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Only they would that we should remember the poor; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 45">m</a>the same which I also was forward to do.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 46">n</a>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 For before that certain came from James, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 47">o</a>he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 48">p</a>before them all, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 49">q</a>If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 50">r</a>We who are Jews by nature, and not <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 51">s</a>sinners of the Gentiles,  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 52">t</a>Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 53">u</a>by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 54">v</a>by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 55">w</a>sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 For I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 56">x</a>through the law <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 57">y</a>am dead to the law, that I might <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 58">z</a>live unto God.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 I am <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 59">a</a>crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 60">b</a>I live by the faith of the Son of God, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 61">c</a>who loved me, and gave himself for me.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 2:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 62">d</a>if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3" class="chapters" >Chapter 3</div>
<div id="Galatians 3:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 This only would I learn of you, Received ye <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 63">a</a>the Spirit by the works of the law, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 64">b</a>or by the hearing of faith?  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 65">c</a>flesh?  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 66">d</a>Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 He therefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 67">e</a>that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Even as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 68">f</a>Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Know ye therefore that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 69">g</a>they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 70">h</a>the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 71">i</a>In thee shall all nations be blessed.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 72">j</a>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 73">k</a>The just shall live by faith.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 74">l</a>the law is not of faith: but, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 75">m</a>The man that doeth them shall live in them.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 76">n</a>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 77">o</a>Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 78">p</a>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 79">q</a>the promise of the Spirit through faith.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 80">r</a>Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 81">s</a>to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 82">t</a>Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 83">u</a>which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 84">v</a>that it should make the promise of none effect.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 For if <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 85">w</a>the inheritance be of the law, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 86">x</a>it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Wherefore then serveth the law? <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 87">y</a>It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 88">z</a>ordained by angels in the hand <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 89">a</a>of a mediator.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Galatians 90">b</a>but God is one.  </div></br>
<div id="Galatians 3:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.  </div></br>
