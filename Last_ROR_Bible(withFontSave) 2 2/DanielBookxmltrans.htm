<div id="Daniel 1" class="chapters" >Chapter 1</div>
<div id="Daniel 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 1">a</a>came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 2">b</a>part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 3">c</a>into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 4">d</a>and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Children <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 5">e</a>in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 6">f</a>whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 7">g</a>stand before the king.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 8">h</a>Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 9">i</a>for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 10">j</a>with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 11">k</a>God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 As for these four children, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 12">l</a>God gave them <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 13">m</a>knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 14">n</a>understanding in all visions and dreams.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 15">o</a>stood they before the king.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 16">p</a>And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 17">q</a>And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Daniel 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 18">a</a>wherewith his spirit was troubled, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 19">b</a>his sleep brake from him.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 20">c</a>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 21">d</a>O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 22">e</a>cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 23">f</a>But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 24">g</a>there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 25">h</a>except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 26">i</a>That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 27">j</a>in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Daniel answered and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 28">k</a>Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 29">l</a>for wisdom and might are his:  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And he changeth <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 30">m</a>the times and the seasons: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 31">n</a>he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 32">o</a>he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 33">p</a>He revealeth the deep and secret things: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 34">q</a>he knoweth what is in the darkness, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 35">r</a>the light dwelleth with him.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 36">s</a>desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 37">t</a>But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 38">u</a>what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 39">v</a>and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 40">w</a>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 41">x</a>and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 42">y</a>This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:34" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;34 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 43">z</a>without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 44">a</a>like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 45">b</a>no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 46">c</a>became a great mountain, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 47">d</a>and filled the whole earth.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:36" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;36 This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:37" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;37 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 48">e</a>Thou, O king, art a king of kings: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 49">f</a>for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.  </div></br>

<div id="Daniel 2:39" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;39 And after thee shall arise <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 52">i</a>another kingdom <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 53">j</a>inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:40" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;40 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 54">k</a>the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:41" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;41 And whereas thou sawest <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 55">l</a>the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:42" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;42 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:43" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;43 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:44" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;44 And in the days of these kings <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 56">m</a>shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 57">n</a>which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 58">o</a>but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:45" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;45 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 59">p</a>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:46" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;46 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 60">q</a>Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 61">r</a>and sweet odours unto him.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:47" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;47 The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 62">s</a>and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 2:48" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;48 Then the king made Daniel a great man, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 63">t</a>and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 64">u</a>chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.  </div></br>

<div id="Daniel 3:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 67">a</a>O people, nations, and languages,  </div></br>

<div id="Daniel 3:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 69">c</a>came near, and accused the Jews.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 70">d</a>O king, live for ever.  </div></br>

<div id="Daniel 3:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.  </div></br>

<div id="Daniel 3:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 74">h</a>we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.  </div></br>

<div id="Daniel 3:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.  </div></br>

<div id="Daniel 3:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 3:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And these three men, Shad-rach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.  </div></br>

<div id="Daniel 3:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 75">i</a>walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 76">j</a>the Son of God.  </div></br>

<div id="Daniel 3:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 77">k</a>upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 3:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 78">l</a>trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.  </div></br>

<div id="Daniel 3:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 Then the king promoted Shad-rach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.  </div></br>

<div id="Daniel 8:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 242">b</a>Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 8:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.  </div></br>
<div id="Daniel 8:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Daniel 243">c</a>but he did according to his will, and became great.  </div></br>
