 <p class="articles"><font size="+3">A</font> lot of people don't really
  know the benefits of praying.
  They feel prayer is a way of convincing
  God to do something for them, a
  means of getting God to accede to
  their requests. So they bombard the
  throne of God with their long list of
  prayer requests, imagining that
  sooner or later, God will call out to
  Archangels Michael and Gabriel to
  swing into action! But, really, you
  don't pray so God can do anything
  for you. Praying, amongst its other
  benefits, conditions your spirit to
  receive!
  The intensity of your prayers isn't
  what brings the answer you seek. On
  God's side, His answer is
  yes! (2 Corinthians 1:20).
  There's really nothing
  you would want to ask for
  that isn't already available
  to you in Christ. So why
  then do we pray?
  We pray because of
  the impact it has on our
  spirits. Look at Jesus; He
  was always praying though
  He was hundred percent
  God in human flesh. He spoke
  openly about His oneness with the
  Father. He didn't merely pray to get
  God to do things for Him or bring
  the power down, for He was the
  embodiment of divinity. Why then
  did He pray? He prayed because of
  what prayer did to His spirit. Every
  time He came down from the
  mountain after praying, tremendous
  miracles followed because He had
  activated the power through prayer
  This is one of the reasons we
  pray. It's not to change God or move
  the hand of God, but to change us.
  When you pray, your spirit is conditioned
  you become more sensitive
  to the Spirit of God and
  the eyes of your spirit are
  opened to see the reality
  of that thing you desire.

   <strong><em>&quot;Pray without
  ceasing&quot;
  (1 Thessalonians 5:17)</em></strong>.<br>
  <br>   
  It becomes easy for you
  to get a more perfect
  picture of the situation
  you're praying about and
  receive answers from the
  Lord.</p>
