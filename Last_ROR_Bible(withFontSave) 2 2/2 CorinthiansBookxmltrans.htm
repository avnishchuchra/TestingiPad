<div id="2 Corinthians 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Paul, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 1">a</a>an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 2">b</a>with all the saints which are in all Achaia:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 3">c</a>Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 4">d</a>Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 For as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 5">e</a>the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 6">f</a>as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 7">g</a>our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 8">h</a>not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 9">i</a>Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Ye also <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 10">j</a>helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 11">k</a>not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 12">l</a>ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And in this confidence <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 13">m</a>I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 14">n</a>a second benefit;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And to pass by you into Macedonia, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 15">o</a>to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 16">p</a>the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 17">q</a>but in him was yea.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 18">r</a>For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 19">s</a>hath anointed us, is God;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 Who <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 20">t</a>hath also sealed us, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 21">u</a>given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 Moreover <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 22">v</a>I call God for a record upon my soul, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 23">w</a>that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 1:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 Not for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 24">x</a>that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 25">y</a>by faith ye stand.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 26">a</a>having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 But <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 27">b</a>if any have caused grief, he hath not <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 28">c</a>grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 29">d</a>of many.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 30">e</a>So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Furthermore, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 31">f</a>when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 32">g</a>a door was opened unto me of the Lord,  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 33">h</a>the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 34">i</a>in them that are saved, and in them that perish:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 35">j</a>To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 36">k</a>who is sufficient for these things?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 For we are not as many, which <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 37">l</a>corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3" class="chapters" >Chapter 3</div>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 38">a</a>epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 39">b</a>Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 40">c</a>ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 41">d</a>in tables of stone, but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 42">e</a>in fleshy tables of the heart.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 43">f</a>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 44">g</a>our sufficiency is of God;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Who also hath made us able <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 45">h</a>ministers of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 46">i</a>the new testament; not <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 47">j</a>of the letter, but of the spirit: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 48">k</a>the letter killeth, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 49">l</a>but the spirit giveth life.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 But if <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 50">m</a>the ministration of death, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 51">n</a>written and engraven in stones, was glorious, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 52">o</a>so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 How shall not <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 53">p</a>the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 54">q</a>of righteousness exceed in glory.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Seeing then that we have such hope, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 55">r</a>we use great plainness of speech:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And not as Moses, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 56">s</a>which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 57">t</a>the end of that which is abolished:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 But <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 58">u</a>their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Nevertheless <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 59">v</a>when it shall turn to the Lord, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 60">w</a>the vail shall be taken away.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 61">x</a>the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 3:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 But we all, with open face beholding <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 62">y</a>as in a glass <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 63">z</a>the glory of the Lord, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 64">a</a>are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 4" class="chapters" >Chapter 4</div>
<div id="2 Corinthians 4:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 65">a</a>as we have received mercy, we faint not;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 4:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 66">b</a>nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 4:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 But if our gospel be hid, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 67">c</a>it is hid to them that are lost:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 4:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 In whom <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 68">d</a>the god of this world <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 69">e</a>hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 70">f</a>who is the image of God, should shine unto them.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 4:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 71">g</a>For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 72">h</a>ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 4:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 For God, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 73">i</a>who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 74">j</a>shined in our hearts, to give <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 75">k</a>the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 4:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 76">l</a>that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 4:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 4:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Persecuted, but not forsaken; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 77">m</a>cast down, but not destroyed;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 4:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 78">n</a>Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 79">o</a>that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Corinthians 8:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;  </div></br>

<div id="2 Corinthians 8:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Corinthians 8:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 As it is written, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 145">i</a>He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 8:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 8:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 8:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 8:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And not that only, but who was also <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 146">j</a>chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 8:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 8:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 147">k</a>Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 8:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 8:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 148">l</a>the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 8:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9" class="chapters" >Chapter 9</div>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 For as touching <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 149">a</a>the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 150">b</a>But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 151">c</a>not grudgingly, or of necessity: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 152">d</a>God loveth a cheerful giver.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 153">e</a>And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 (As it is written, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 154">f</a>He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Now he that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 155">g</a>ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 156">h</a>righteousness;)  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 157">i</a>glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 158">j</a>distribution unto them, and unto all men;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 9:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Thanks be unto God <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 159">k</a>for his unspeakable gift.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10" class="chapters" >Chapter 10</div>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 160">a</a>I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 But I beseech you, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 161">b</a>that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 162">c</a>(For the weapons <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 163">d</a>of our warfare are not carnal, but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 164">e</a>mighty through God <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 165">f</a>to the pulling down of strong holds;)  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 166">g</a>Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 167">h</a>Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 168">i</a>If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 169">j</a>we Christ's.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 170">k</a>his bodily presence is weak, and his <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 171">l</a>speech contemptible.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 172">m</a>for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 173">n</a>of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 174">o</a>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 10:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 175">p</a>not he that commendeth himself is approved, but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 176">q</a>whom the Lord commendeth.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11" class="chapters" >Chapter 11</div>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 For I am <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 177">a</a>jealous over you with godly jealousy: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 178">b</a>I have espoused you to one husband, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 179">c</a>that I may present you <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 180">d</a>as a chaste virgin to Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 But I fear, lest by any means, as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 181">e</a>the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 182">f</a>should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 183">g</a>another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 For I suppose <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 184">h</a>I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 But though <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 185">i</a>I be rude in speech, yet not <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 186">j</a>in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Have I committed an offence <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 187">k</a>in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And when I was present with you, and wanted, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 188">l</a>I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 189">m</a>the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 190">n</a>As the truth of Christ is in me, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 191">o</a>no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 But what I do, that I will do, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 192">p</a>that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 For such <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 193">q</a>are false apostles, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 194">r</a>deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 195">s</a>an angel of light.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 196">t</a>whose end shall be according to their works.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 That which I speak, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 197">u</a>I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 198">v</a>Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 For ye suffer fools gladly, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 199">w</a>seeing ye yourselves are wise.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 For ye suffer, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 200">x</a>if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Corinthians 11:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Corinthians 201">y</a>whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.  </div></br>
