<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>THE DAYS OF THE LATTER RAIN</b></font></p>



<p class="articles"><font size="+3">W</font>e're living in the days of
the latter rain, the time of
supernatural harvest and prosperity!
These are the days the patriarchs and
the prophets of old spoke of. The
Lord Jesus called it <em>&quot;the days of great
harvest.&quot; He said, &quot;...The harvest truly
is great, but the labourers are few...&quot; </em>(Luke 10:2). Indeed the labourers
were few at the time.
The Bible says,<em> &quot;Be
patient therefore, brethren,
unto the coming of
the Lord. Behold, the
husbandman waiteth for
the precious fruit of the
earth, and hath long
patience for it, until he
receive the early and
latter rain&quot;</em> (James 5:7).
There's a strong move of
God's power in our time.
The Lord has sent the
former rain and the latter
rain together (Joel 2:23),
so we can reap an unprecedented
harvest of souls with ease.
You don't need to struggle to win
souls anymore. Hallelujah!
What's more, the former rain
and the latter rain also bring financial
and spiritual prosperity. Thus the
same way the Word of God prevailed
in Ephesus (Acts 19:20), the gospel
of Christ is also growing and making
tremendous impact in our day.<em><strong> <br>
<br>
<em>&quot; Ask ye of the
LORD rain in the time
of the latter rain; so
the LORD shall make
bright clouds, and give
them showers of rain,
to every one grass in
the field&quot;
(Zechariah 10:1).</em><br>
<br>
</strong></em>There couldn't be a
better time to declare
the goodness of the
Lord and the great things
He's doing in our midst
than now.
We must thank the
Lord for giving us the
opportunity to reign,
grow and increase at
this time, for these are
the days of His glory!
Surely, it's the best time
to be alive.
