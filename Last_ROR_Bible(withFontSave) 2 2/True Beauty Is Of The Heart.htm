<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>TRUE BEAUTY IS OF THE HEART</b></font></p>
 
<p class="articles"><font size="+3">B</font>eauty has been mistaken for
outward appearance and this
is highly deceptive. Some folks have
all the features of a model, yet their
hearts are extremely darkened with
evil. By virtue of this, their beauty
becomes irritating. Instead of creating
a sense of admiration, people are
nauseated by their appearance.
People avoid them instead of longing
to get to know them.
The Bible says, &quot;Favour
is deceitful, and beauty is
vain: but a woman that
feareth the LORD, she
shall be praised&quot; (Proverbs
31:30), and this is so true!
Sin dominates anyone
who is not born-again;
this is why they can't
reflect the true beauty of
God. The beauty of the
heart is seen in the
recreated human spirit of
a born again Christian,
one who is alive to God
and dead to sin.
Every person can be beautiful.
However, true beauty is reflected
from the heart. The Lord Jesus said,
  <em>&quot;A good man out of the good treasure
of the heart bringeth forth good
things: and an evil man out of the evil
treasure bringeth forth evil things&quot; </em>(Matthew 12:35). It's what you have
in your heart that'll be reflected and
revealed in your words, actions and<em><strong> </strong></em>character. <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;Whose adorning
let it not be that
outward adorning of
plaiting the hair, and
of wearing of gold,
or of putting on of
apparel; But let it be
the hidden man of the
heart, in that which
is not corruptible,
even the ornament
of a meek and quiet
spirit, which is in the
sight of God of great
price&quot;
(1 Peter 3:3-4).<br>
</strong></em><br>
  There's no
  beauty that can overshadow
  that of a righteous
  heart, for it's only in such
  hearts that God can
dwell.</p>
