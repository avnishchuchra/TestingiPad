<P class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>W</b></font>hen the children of Israel
left Egypt, they came to
the Red Sea and their adversaries,
the Egyptians, were fast advancing
toward them from behind. Then
Moses cried out to God for help but
God said, <em>&quot;Moses, why do you cry to
Me. Tell the people to go forward!&quot; </em>(Exodus 14:15-16). God's response is
most remarkable because Moses had
thought it was God's responsibility,
but God said, &quot;No, you do something;
it's your responsibility!&quot;
We oftentimes blame God for
what isn't His responsibility. God has
already done everything He needed
to do. Everything else is entirely up
to us. God doesn't want
you to wait any longer;
He's given you His Word
and shown you the Kingdom
principle, so DO IT!
It's the doer of the Word
that's blessed in his deeds
(James 1:25).
There was a severe
famine in Israel and the
king had no solution, so
he sent an SOS message to Elisha, a
prophet of God. Prior to that, Elisha
had being waiting on God to
transform the economy of the
country, but nothing was happening.
Why? Because God was waiting on
him to do something!
In 2 Kings 7:1, Elisha declared
prosperity upon the land. And within
twenty-four hours from the time he
spoke, the economy of the nation
was transformed.
The knowledge of God's Word
is so important. You can't live
victoriously in Christ in this life
without it. If you're just sitting there,
twiddling your thumbs and expecting<em><strong> </strong></em>something good to turn
up, your bills will continue
to pile up. <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;And the LORD
said unto Moses,
Wherefore criest
thou unto me? speak
unto the children of
Israel, that they go
forward&quot; (Exodus 14:15).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
Rather, make
good things happen.
Receive God's direction
today and go right ahead
to do whatever He's told
you.</P>
