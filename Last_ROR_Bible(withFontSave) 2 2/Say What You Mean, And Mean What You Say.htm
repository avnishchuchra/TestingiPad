<p class="articles"><font size="+3">I</font>n the realm of the spirit, words
are extremely important. That's
why the Lord Jesus said that by your
words you'll be justified, and by your
words you'll be condemned. Interpreting
the Master's words literally
means a man will go to heaven or
hell because of what he said or didn't
say. But beyond that, your life is the
character of your words. If a man's
words are confusing, his
life will be confusing. In
the same way, if a man's
words are wholesome,
his life will be wholesome.
This is why you must
watch what you say!
Some people in their
mouth-work are sometimes
positive, and at
other times negative, and
that's the reason they
experience a lot of ups
and downs in their lives.
In the realm of the spirit,
you have what you say,
whether or not you
meant it. In Mark 11:23,
Jesus didn't say &quot;You
shall have what you mean,&quot; He said
  <em>&quot;You shall have what you say.&quot;</em> If you must make any joke, let it
be positive and don't joke against
the Word. Don't make careless
statements, for they'll produce
results for you. That's why you must
say only what you mean, and mean
whatever you say.
Remember, God holds you accountable for the things
you say. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;But I say unto
you, That every
idle word that men
shall speak, they
shall give account
thereof in the day of
judgment. For by thy
words thou shalt be
justified, and by thy
words thou shalt be
condemned&quot; (Matthew 12:36-37).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
So build your life
with your words. Your
life can't be different
from the words you
speak. Therefore, make
it a conscious exercise
to store God's Word in
your heart, for out of
the abundance of the
heart, the mouth speaks
(Matthew 12:34). As
God's Word dwells richly
in your heart, you'll
develop and speak faithfilled
words.</p>
