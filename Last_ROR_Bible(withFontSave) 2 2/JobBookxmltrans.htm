<div id="Job 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 There was a man <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 1">a</a>in the land of Uz, whose name was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 2">b</a>Job; and that man was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 3">c</a>perfect and upright, and one that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 4">d</a>feared God, and eschewed evil.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 5">e</a>and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 6">f</a>cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 7">g</a>there was a day <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 8">h</a>when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 9">i</a>going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And the LORD said unto Satan, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 10">j</a>Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 11">k</a>a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 12">l</a>Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 13">m</a>thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 14">n</a>But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 15">o</a>curse thee to thy face.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And there was a day <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 16">p</a>when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 17">q</a>Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Then Job arose, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 18">r</a>and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 19">s</a>fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 20">t</a>Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 21">u</a>gave, and the LORD hath <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 22">v</a>taken away; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 23">w</a>blessed be the name of the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 1:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 24">x</a>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Job 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Again <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 25">a</a>there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 26">b</a>Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 27">c</a>a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 28">d</a>holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 29">e</a>to destroy him without cause.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 30">f</a>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 31">g</a>bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 32">h</a>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 33">i</a>from the sole of his foot unto his crown.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 34">j</a>and he sat down among the ashes.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Then said his wife unto him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 35">k</a>Dost thou still <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 36">l</a>retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 37">m</a>shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 38">n</a>In all this did not Job <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 39">o</a>sin with his lips.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Now when Job's three <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 40">p</a>friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 41">q</a>Temanite, and Bildad the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 42">r</a>Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 43">s</a>to mourn with him and to comfort him.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 44">t</a>sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 So they sat down with him upon the ground <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 45">u</a>seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3" class="chapters" >Chapter 3</div>
<div id="Job 3:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And Job spake, and said,  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 46">a</a>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Let darkness and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 47">b</a>the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Let them curse it that curse the day, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 48">c</a>who are ready to raise up their mourning.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 49">d</a>Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?  </div></br>

<div id="Job 3:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 There the prisoners rest together; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 53">h</a>they hear not the voice of the oppressor.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 54">i</a>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 55">j</a>bitter in soul;  </div></br>

<div id="Job 3:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 58">m</a>and whom God hath hedged in?  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 3:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.  </div></br>

<div id="Job 4:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,  </div></br>

<div id="Job 4:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Even as I have seen, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 64">f</a>they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 4:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 4:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 65">g</a>the teeth of the young lions, are broken.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 4:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Job 66">h</a>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.  </div></br>
<div id="Job 4:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.  </div></br>

<div id="Job 4:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:  </div></br>
