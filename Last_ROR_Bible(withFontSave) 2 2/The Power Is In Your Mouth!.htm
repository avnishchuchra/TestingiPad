<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>THE POWER IS IN MOUTH</b></font></p>


<P class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he power of the tongue is an
unfamiliar subject to many
Christians today. The Bible didn't say
that death and life are in God's hands.
Rather, it says they are in the power
of the tongue! The tongue is small in
size but it directs the course of your
life!
Often times, when people want
something from God, they'll cry, roll
on the floor, whine and bellyache,
not realizing that the power to get
what they want is in their mouths.
Jesus taught on the creative power
and potency of our mouth-work in
Mark 11:23: <em>&quot;For verily I say unto
you, That whosoever shall say unto
this mountain, Be thou
removed, and be thou
cast into the sea; and shall
not doubt in his heart,
but shall believe that
those things which he
saith shall come to pass;
he shall have whatsoever
he saith.&quot; </em>God has given you
His Word and a tongue
to create the future you
desire. You can be everything God
has planned for you to be and attain
the highest height of success in life if
you'd learn to use your tongue right.
Never talk failure, weakness, sickness,
lack or fear! Speak faith-filled words
all the time. Build your future with
your tongue.
The power to live a successful,
prosperous, glorious and victorious
life is in your mouth, not with the
Lord. He has already done all that's
necessary for you to live a glorious
life; now He expects your confessions
- every word you speak-to align
with His Word. Are there good
things you desire in your life today?<em><strong> <br>
<br>
<em>&quot; Death and life are
in the power of the
tongue: and they that
love it shall eat the
fruit thereof&quot;
(Proverbs 18:21).</em><br>
<br>
</strong></em>All you need do is speak
them forth; believe the
words of Jesus that you
shall have what you say.
That's faith! No matter
what the problem may
be or how big it may
seem, the solution is in
your mouth; speak God's
Word and see it resolved.
