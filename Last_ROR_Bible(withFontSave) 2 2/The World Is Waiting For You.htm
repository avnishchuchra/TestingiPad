<p class="articles"><font size="+3">W</font>hen God created the world,
everything He made was
good, and He gave man dominion
over His creation. But when sin
entered the world through Adam's
transgression, death also came in
and from that point on, everything in
the world became subject to decay
and regression. That's why today,
everything that exists in the world,
living and non-living, is crying out for
liberation. Men are groaning under
the weight of sickness, disease and
poverty; even money is crying out to
be delivered from those who use it
for evil.
The only hope for the world are
the sons of God, and that's
why Scripture declares
that the whole of creation
is waiting for the manifestation
of the &quot;sons&quot; of
God. The word &quot;sons&quot; is
from the Greek word
&quot;huios&quot; and it means the
matured sons of God,
those who have come of
age spiritually. The matured
sons of God are those
who know how to dominate sickness,
disease, poverty, and the forces of
nature! They are the ones who
command prosperity for the sake of
the Kingdom, and rescue men and
women from darkness.
Make up your mind not to remain
in the babyhood stage of Christianity.
Grow up to maturity because the
world is waiting for you! God wants
to deliver great things to matured
sons and daughters, for He knows
they can handle responsibilities. He
is waiting for His kids to come to
that place of maturity in Christ,
where they'll rise up and subdue the
systems of the world.<strong><em> <br>
<br>
&quot;For the earnest
expectation of the
creature waiteth for
the manifestation of
the sons of God&quot; (Romans 8:19).</em></strong> <br>
<br>
Take your Christian
growth very seriously.
It's only in the position of
maturity in Christ that you
can take your place as
the &quot;huios&quot; (matured son)
of God and bring deliverance,
healing, salvation
and joy to a hurting
world.</p>
