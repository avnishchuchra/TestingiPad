<div id="Zechariah 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 In the eighth month, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 1">a</a>in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 2">b</a>unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 3">c</a>ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Be ye not as your fathers, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 4">d</a>unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 5">e</a>Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 But <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 6">f</a>my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 7">g</a>Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 I saw by night, and behold <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 8">h</a>a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 9">i</a>red horses, speckled, and white.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 10">j</a>These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 11">k</a>And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 12">l</a>O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 13">m</a>these threescore and ten years?  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 14">n</a>good words and comfortable words.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 15">o</a>jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 16">p</a>I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Therefore thus saith the LORD; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 17">q</a>I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 18">r</a>a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 19">s</a>and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 20">t</a>shall yet choose Jerusalem.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 21">u</a>These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 22">v</a>lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Zechariah 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 23">a</a>a man with a measuring line in his hand.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 24">b</a>To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 25">c</a>Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 26">d</a>a wall of fire round about, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 27">e</a>and will be the glory in the midst of her.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Ho, ho, come forth, and flee <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 28">f</a>from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 29">g</a>spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 30">h</a>Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 31">i</a>toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 For, behold, I will <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 32">j</a>shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 33">k</a>ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 34">l</a>Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 35">m</a>will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 36">n</a>And many nations shall be joined to the LORD <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 37">o</a>in that day, and shall be <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 38">p</a>my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 39">q</a>thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And the LORD shall <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 40">r</a>inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 41">s</a>shall choose Jerusalem again.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 42">t</a>Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 43">u</a>out of his holy habitation.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 3" class="chapters" >Chapter 3</div>
<div id="Zechariah 3:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And he shewed me <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 44">a</a>Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 45">b</a>Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And the LORD said unto Satan, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 46">c</a>The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 47">d</a>hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 48">e</a>is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Now Joshua was clothed with <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 49">f</a>filthy garments, and stood before the angel.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 50">g</a>and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 3:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And I said, Let them set a fair <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 51">h</a>mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 3:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 3:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 52">i</a>keep my charge, then thou shalt also <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 53">j</a>judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 54">k</a>stand by.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 3:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 55">l</a>men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 56">m</a>my servant the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 57">n</a>BRANCH.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 58">o</a>upon one stone shall be <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 59">p</a>seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 60">q</a>I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 3:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 61">r</a>In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 62">s</a>under the vine and under the fig tree.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 4" class="chapters" >Chapter 4</div>
<div id="Zechariah 4:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 63">a</a>the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 64">b</a>as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 4:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 65">c</a>a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 66">d</a>and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof:  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 4:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 67">e</a>And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 4:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 4:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 4:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 68">f</a>Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 4:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Who art thou, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 69">g</a>O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 70">h</a>the headstone thereof <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 71">i</a>with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 4:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 4:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 The hands of Zerubbabel <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 72">j</a>have laid the foundation of this house; his hands <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 73">k</a>shall also finish it; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 74">l</a>thou shalt know that the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 75">m</a>LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 4:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 For who hath despised the day of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 76">n</a>small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 77">o</a>they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 4:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 78">p</a>two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 4:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 4:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 4:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Then said he, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 79">q</a>These are the two anointed ones, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 80">r</a>that stand by <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 81">s</a>the Lord of the whole earth.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 5" class="chapters" >Chapter 5</div>
<div id="Zechariah 5:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 82">a</a>roll.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 5:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 5:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Then said he unto me, This is the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 83">b</a>curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.  </div></br>
<div id="Zechariah 5:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 84">c</a>him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Zachariah 85">d</a>shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.  </div></br>
