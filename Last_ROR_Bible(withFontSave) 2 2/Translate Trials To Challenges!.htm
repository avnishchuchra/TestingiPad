<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>TRANSLATE TRAILS TO<br> 
CHALLENGES!</b></font></p>
 
<p class="articles"><font size="+3">S</font>o many things happen to us in
life, but the way we interprete
them determine our response to
them. The full knowledge of our
identity is very important. When the
Bible says that you're more than a
conqueror, it infers an assurance of
victory. No force can throw you off
balance. Thus, when trials come your
way, translate them to challenges.
That's the mindset of victors. Only
victors translate problems into
challenges.
The right attitude is very vital for
dynamic Christian living. Some folks
act amoebic when they face trials.
They change their confessions and
lifestyles to create &quot;adaptive
features&quot; for the
time being. They forget
the ways of the Lord and
all His goodness and opt
for a faithless lifestyle.
Things never get better
for them because their life is not
consistent with the Word.
Your consistency in the profession
of your faith is one of the most
essential of all Christian attitudes.
Remain unshakable in speaking
God's Word, no matter what you
see or how disastrous the situation
may seem. You must be wise to walk
with a consciousness of your identity.
You must find out what God says
about you and the temporary
circumstance you're facing. Then
speak the mind of God to yourself
concerning the seemingly 'dead'
case.
Keep speaking and doing God's<em><strong> </strong></em>Word and every anomaly
in your life will be put in
check and in conformity
to God's Word. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;For our light
affliction, which is
but for a moment,
worketh for us a far
more exceeding and
eternal weight of
glory&quot; (2 Corinthians 4:17).</em></strong><br>
<br>
See trials
as surmountable challenges,
and as opportunities
for the glory of
God to be revealed in
your life.</p>
