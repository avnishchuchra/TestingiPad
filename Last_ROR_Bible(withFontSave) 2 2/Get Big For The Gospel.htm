<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Lord Jesus charged His
disciples in Mark 16:15 to go
into all the world and preach the
gospel to every creature. Preaching
the gospel to the entire world goes
beyond reaching people one by one;
it involves organizing and holding
outreach crusades, having Christian
teaching programmes on TV, printing
and distributing evangelical materials,
and so on. All these cost a lot of
money, thus we ought to get big
financially so we can sponsor the
gospel around the world big-time.
The Bible says a poor man's
wisdom is despised; in other words,
his gospel is not heard since his
words are despised. He
may shout at the top of
his voice, his reach will
still be limited as he's
unable to afford the right
platforms that'll cause
whatever he has to say
to make the necessary
impact. &quot;All the brethren
of the poor do hate him:
how much more do his
friends go far from him?
he pursueth them with words, yet
they are wanting to him&quot; (Proverbs
19:7).
Refuse to be poor! Don't be like
those who ask, &quot;Must every Christian
be rich?&quot; Nobody said everyone
must be rich, but who says you
shouldn't be? Make up your mind to
reject poverty; never accept it for
one moment. God doesn't want you
poor. That's why He gave us His
Word, so we can learn how to deal
wisely in life and profit in all our
endeavours. He's given us the
wisdom to get wealth, not because
He's after riches, but because He
wants us to advance His Kingdom.

<em><strong>&quot;Then said I,
Wisdom is better than
strength: nevertheless
the poor man's
wisdom is despised,
and his words are not
heard&quot;
(Ecclesiastes 9:16).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
He says &quot;My cities through
prosperity shall yet be
spread abroad...&quot; (Zechariah
1:17).
Thus, the reason for
our collective and individual
wealth as Christians
is so we can spread the
gospel and cause the
Kingdom of God to
move forward; so get big
for the gospel's sake.</p>
