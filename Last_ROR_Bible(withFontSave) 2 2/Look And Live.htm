<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>D</b></font>uring their journey through
the wilderness, many of the
children of Israel were killed by fiery
serpents that invaded their camp
when they spoke against God and
Moses His servant. Moses prayed to
God for mercy and God instructed
him to make a serpent of brass and
set it upon a pole, and if anyone who
was bitten by a fiery serpent looked
upon this brazen serpent,
he was healed and didn't
die. Now in the New
Testament, the Lord Jesus
likened Himself to this
serpent Moses lifted up
on the pole (John 3:14-
15).
Are you sick in your
body? Have you given
up hope of ever being
healed? God is more
willing to heal you than
you are willing to be
healed (Acts 10:38). He's touched
with the feeling of your infirmities,
but firstly you have to make up your
mind for something: You must
accept and receive the Healer. The
Giver of the gift is more important
than the gift He gives! And the next
thing is to have faith in His Word.
The Amplified translation of
Hebrews 12:2 says, &quot;Looking away<em><strong> </strong></em>[from all that will
distract] to Jesus...&quot; <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;And the LORD said
unto Moses, Make
thee a fiery serpent,
and set it upon a pole:
and it shall come to
pass, that every one
that is bitten, when he
looketh upon it, shall
live. And Moses made
a serpent of brass,
and put it upon a pole,
and it came to pass,
that if a serpent had
bitten any man, when
he beheld the serpent
of brass, he lived&quot;
(Numbers 21:8-9).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
It
means to look away
from your problem; it
could distract you. Look
away from your pains;
look away from that
growth; look away from
the doctor's report; look
away from the sore and
everything around you.
Fix your gaze on the
Healer and His Word to
you and you shall live!</p>
