<div id="Joshua 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,  </div></br>

<div id="Joshua 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 19">s</a>be with thee, as he was with Moses.  </div></br>

<div id="Joshua 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Joshua 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And Joshua the son of Nun sent <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 20">a</a>out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho.

<div id="Joshua 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.  </div></br>

<div id="Joshua 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 26">g</a>your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 For we have heard how the LORD <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 27">h</a>dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 28">i</a>what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And as soon as we had <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 29">j</a>heard these things, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 30">k</a>our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 31">l</a>the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Now therefore, I pray you, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 32">m</a>swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 33">n</a>my father's house, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 34">o</a>give me a true token:  </div></br>

<div id="Joshua 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And the men answered her, Our life for your's, if ye utter not this our business.

<div id="Joshua 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Then she <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 36">q</a>let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And the men said unto her, We will be <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 37">r</a>blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 38">s</a>Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 39">t</a>and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 2:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 40">u</a>his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 2:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 2:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 2:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.  </div></br>

<div id="Joshua 3:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And thou shalt command <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 51">j</a>the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 52">k</a>ye shall stand still in Jordan.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.  </div></br>

<div id="Joshua 5:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 91">e</a>All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.  </div></br>

<div id="Joshua 5:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come.

<div id="Joshua 6:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.  </div></br>

<div id="Joshua 6:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.  </div></br>

<div id="Joshua 7:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:  </div></br>

<div id="Joshua 7:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 143">u</a>give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 144">v</a>and make confession unto him; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 145">w</a>tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.  </div></br>

<div id="Joshua 7:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 7:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.  </div></br>

<div id="Joshua 8:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 154">c</a>Jericho and her king: only <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 155">d</a>the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 156">e</a>ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 157">f</a>we will flee before them,  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 158">g</a>See, I have commanded you.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 159">h</a>And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 160">i</a>wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And Joshua and all Israel <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 161">j</a>made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand.

<div id="Joshua 8:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 162">k</a>let none of them remain or escape.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 8:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.  </div></br>

<div id="Joshua 8:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 165">n</a>an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day.  </div></br>

<div id="Joshua 8:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 169">r</a>in mount Ebal,  </div></br>

Now their cities were <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 194">o</a>Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 9:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And the children of Israel smote them not, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 195">p</a>because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 9:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 9:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 196">q</a>wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 9:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 197">r</a>hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 198">s</a>promised them.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 9:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 199">t</a>We are very far from you; when <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 200">u</a>ye dwell among us?  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 9:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 Now therefore ye are <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 201">v</a>cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 202">w</a>hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 9:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 203">x</a>commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 204">y</a>we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 9:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And now, behold, we are <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 205">z</a>in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 9:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 9:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 And Joshua made them that day <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 206">a</a>hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 207">b</a>in the place which he should choose.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10" class="chapters" >Chapter 10</div>
<div id="Joshua 10:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 208">a</a>as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 209">b</a>Ai and her king; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 210">c</a>how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 That they <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 211">d</a>feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 212">e</a>for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 213">f</a>gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 214">g</a>to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 215">h</a>all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And the LORD said unto Joshua, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 216">i</a>Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 217">j</a>there shall not a man of them stand before thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And the LORD <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 218">k</a>discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 219">l</a>to Bethhoron, and smote them to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 220">m</a>Azekah, and unto Makkedah.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth-horon, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 221">n</a>that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 222">o</a>Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 223">p</a>Ajalon.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 224">q</a>Is not this written in the book of Jasher?

<div id="Joshua 10:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And there was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 225">r</a>no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 226">s</a>the LORD fought for Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 227">t</a>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 228">u</a>none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 229">v</a>put your feet upon the necks of these kings.

<div id="Joshua 10:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And Joshua said unto them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 230">w</a>Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 231">x</a>thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 232">y</a>were hanging upon the trees until the evening.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 233">z</a>took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.  </div></br>
<div id="Joshua 10:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Joshua 234">a</a>as he did unto the king of Jericho.  </div></br>
