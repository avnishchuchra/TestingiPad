<div id="Habakkuk 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 O LORD, how long shall I cry, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 1">a</a>and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 2">b</a>wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 3">c</a>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 For, lo, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 4">d</a>I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 5">e</a>evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 6">f</a>they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 7">g</a>imputing this his power unto his god.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 8">h</a>Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 9">i</a>thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 10">j</a>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 11">k</a>wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 They <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 12">l</a>take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Therefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 13">m</a>they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 I will <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 14">a</a>stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 15">b</a>and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And the LORD answered me, and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 16">c</a>Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 17">d</a>the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 18">e</a>surely come, it will not tarry.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 19">f</a>just shall live by his faith.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 20">g</a>as hell, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Shall not all these <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 21">h</a>take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 22">i</a>Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 23">j</a>because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Woe to him that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 24">k</a>coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 25">l</a>set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned against thy soul.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Woe to him that buildeth a town with <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 26">m</a>blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 27">n</a>that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 For the earth shall be filled with the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 28">o</a>knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 29">p</a>bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 30">q</a>look on their nakedness!  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Thou art filled with shame for glory: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 31">r</a>drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 32">s</a>because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.  </div></br>

<div id="Habakkuk 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 40">b</a>revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 God came from Teman, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 41">c</a>and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 3:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 42">d</a>Before him went the pestilence, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 43">e</a>burning coals went forth at his feet.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 3:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 44">f</a>and the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 45">g</a>everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 3:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 3:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 46">h</a>that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word.

<div id="Habakkuk 3:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 52">n</a>thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.  </div></br>
<div id="Habakkuk 3:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Habakkuk 53">o</a>thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck.

<div id="Habakkuk 3:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:  </div></br>
