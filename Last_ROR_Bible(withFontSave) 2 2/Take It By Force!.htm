<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>TAKE IT BY FORCE!</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+3">W</font>henever you pray or study
God's Word on your own
or in church together with other
believers, you're invigorated spiritually.
However, the true battle begins
the moment you open your eyes or
step out of the door of the church
building. I'm talking life's everyday
challenges: the old friends, habits,
pains... financial crisis, which you must
confront and ultimately conquer. But
you can't win until you're conversant
with the Word of God.
As you grow in God's Word, you
become awakened to the realities of
God's provision for you through
Christ Jesus. And through this knowledge,
you live victoriously.
If the knowledge
you have of God's Word
is insufficient, then you
have unwittingly made
yourself the devil's prime
target.
As you acquire more
knowledge of God's Word,
you must also learn to
appropriate all that's written
for your benefit into
your life. However, you may not get
whatever you desire just because
it's written in the Bible. There are
forces out there working to keep
you from possessing those things
which legally and rightfully belong
to you in Christ. For this reason,
you've got to be violent to possess
your possession. The Lord Jesus said,
  <em>&quot;...the kingdom of heaven suffereth
violence, and the violent take it by
force&quot; </em>(Matthew 11:12). You've also
got to fight the good fight of faith
everyday (1 Timothy 6:12). Though
the weapons of your warfare aren't
physical, yet, they are mightily
effective through God (2 Corinthians<em><strong> </strong></em>10:4).
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;But upon mount
Zion shall be
deliverance, and there
shall be holiness; and
the house of Jacob
shall possess their
possessions&quot;
(Obadiah 1:17).</em></strong><br>
<br>
Just as Abraham refused
to consider his body
or his wife's infertility so
also you mustn't consider
your situation but continually
call yourself what
God says you are in His
Word. Refuse to stagger
or vacillate. Stick with
what the Word says for
as long as it takes you to
get what you want.</p>
