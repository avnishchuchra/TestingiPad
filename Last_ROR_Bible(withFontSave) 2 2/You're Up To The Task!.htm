<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he word &quot;sufficiency&quot; in 2
Corinthians 3:5 also means
&quot;competence.&quot; It is translated from
the Greek word &quot;hikanotes&quot; which
means to have competence or ability.
It refers to the quality of being adequately
qualified physically, intellectually
and in other areas for the
purpose of carrying out a task. Put
simply, it means to be up to the task.
The Apostle Paul in (2 Corinthians
3:5) was saying we're up to the task,
any task!
That means no matter the task or
assignment committed to you, see
yourself as the right man or woman
for the job! If you would imbibe this
mindset, it'll set you apart
for greatness and success,
be it in your work, at
school, or in your business.
Prior to this time, you
may have been described
as that seemingly incompetent
person-the guy
who always messes things
up, but God is saying to
you today, &quot;Son, daughter,
you're up to the task!
You have super-competence, for
your sufficiency is of Me!&quot;
You're competent enough to
face whatever challenges come your
way and produce excellence. You're
up to that task in the office! Refuse
to believe those who consider you
not good enough for the job; tell
yourself, &quot;I am up to the task.&quot;
Remember, your &quot;competence&quot; is
not described by your own physical
or mental prowess, but according to
the supernatural ability of God
working in you. This was what gave
the Apostle Paul the &quot;I-can-domentality&quot;
(Philippians 4:13)!
Like Paul, recognize today that<em><strong> </strong></em>God is at work in you
and you function with His
ability. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Not that we are
sufficient of ourselves
to think any thing
as of ourselves; but
our sufficiency is of
God;&quot;
(2 Corinthians 3:5).</em></strong><br>
<br>
Never act as
though you're not qualified
for any task, even if
it's a new assignment on
your job. Remember, the
Spirit of God is your
sufficiency; He has made
you competent-you're
up to any task.</p>
