<div id="1 Corinthians 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Even as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 12">l</a>the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 So that ye come behind in no gift; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 13">m</a>waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:  </div></br>

<div id="1 Corinthians 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 16">p</a>God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 17">q</a>the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 18">r</a>that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 19">s</a>Apollos; and I of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 20">t</a>Cephas; and I of Christ.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Corinthians 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 I thank God that I baptized none of you, but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 22">v</a>Crispus and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 23">w</a>Gaius;  </div></br>

<div id="1 Corinthians 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 24">x</a>not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 For the preaching of the cross is to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 25">y</a>them that perish <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 26">z</a>foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 27">a</a>power of God.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 For it is written, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 28">b</a>I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 29">c</a>Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 30">d</a>hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 31">e</a>For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 For the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 32">f</a>Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 But we preach Christ crucified, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 33">g</a>unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 34">h</a>the power of God, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 35">i</a>the wisdom of God.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 36">j</a>not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 But <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 37">k</a>God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 38">l</a>things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:  </div></br>

<div id="1 Corinthians 1:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 40">n</a>righteousness, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 41">o</a>sanctification, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 42">p</a>redemption:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 1:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 That, according as it is written, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 43">q</a>He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="1 Corinthians 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 44">a</a>came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 45">b</a>save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 46">c</a>I was with you <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 47">d</a>in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And my speech and my preaching <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 48">e</a>was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 49">f</a>but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 50">g</a>in the power of God.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 51">h</a>that are perfect: yet not <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 52">i</a>the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 53">j</a>which God ordained before the world unto our glory:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 54">k</a>Which none of the princes of this world knew: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 55">l</a>had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 But as it is written, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 56">m</a>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Corinthians 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 58">o</a>save the spirit of man which is in him? <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 59">p</a>even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 60">q</a>the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Corinthians 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 I have fed you with <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 68">b</a>milk, and not with meat: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Corinthians 69">c</a>for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Corinthians 14:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 14:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 What is it then?

<div id="1 Corinthians 14:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 14:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:  </div></br>
<div id="1 Corinthians 14:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Corinthians 14:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Corinthians 14:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.  </div></br>
