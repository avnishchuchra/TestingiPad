<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>THE POWER OF THE<br> 
SPOKEN WORD</b></font></p>


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">I</font>n Mark 11:23, the Lord Jesus
showed us the tremendous
power in the words we speak. A day
earlier, He had cursed a fig tree but
the tree didn't shrivel away instantly-
it still looked perfectly normal as He
walked away.
So the next day, as they passed
by, observed that the fig tree had
dried up from its roots,. What they
didn't realize was that
when the Master instructed
the tree to die, it died
instantly-its life-source
was cut off from the roots.
Since the roots were
inside the ground and
couldn't be seen, it
appeared for a while as if
nothing happened. But
sure enough, with the
life-source destroyed, it
was only a matter of time
before the effects of the
Master's words showed
up in the stem, branches
and leaves.
Jesus didn't remain
standing in front of the
fig tree screaming out, &quot;You've got
to die now! I've already said die, so
die you must.&quot; No, He walked away,
convinced that what He said was
done. That's faith. When you speak
forth words of faith, realize that they
take effect immediately in the realm
of the spirit, whether or not you see
any physical change outwardly.
For example, if you were told of



  
a tumour in your body,
the moment you say, &quot;I
command this tumour
to die and pass out of
my body in the Name
of Jesus,&quot; it's done. <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;For verily I say
unto you, That
whosoever shall say
unto this mountain,
Be thou removed,
and be thou cast into
the sea; and shall not
doubt in his heart,
but shall believe that
those things which
he saith shall come
to pass; he shall have
whatsoever he saith&quot;
(Mark 11:23)</strong></em><br>
<br> 
The
lump might still be there
physically, but it doesn't
make any difference; do
as the Master did-forget
about it and expect
your faith declaration to
prevail. There's tremendous
power in your
words, so go ahead now
and speak faith-filled
words, and change that
hopeless situation.</p>
