<div id="2 Kings 1" class="chapters" >Chapter 1</div>
<div id="2 Kings 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Then Moab <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 1">a</a>rebelled against Israel <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 2">b</a>after the death of Ahab.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baal-zebub the god of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 3">c</a>Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And they answered him, He was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 4">d</a>an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 5">e</a>let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 6">f</a>be precious in thy sight.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead, in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="2 Kings 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And it came to pass, when the LORD would <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 7">a</a>take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 8">b</a>Elisha from Gilgal.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And Elijah said unto Elisha, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 9">c</a>Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 10">d</a>as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 11">e</a>the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 12">f</a>they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 13">g</a>a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 14">h</a>My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 15">i</a>they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And when the sons of the prophets which were <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 16">j</a>to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 17">k</a>lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 18">l</a>cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And he went up from thence unto Beth-el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 2:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3" class="chapters" >Chapter 3</div>
<div id="2 Kings 3:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 19">a</a>Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 20">b</a>that his father had made.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Nevertheless he cleaved unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 21">c</a>the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 22">d</a>lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 But it came to pass, when <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 23">e</a>Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 24">f</a>I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 But <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 25">g</a>Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 26">h</a>went down to him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 27">i</a>What have I to do with thee? <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 28">j</a>get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 29">k</a>the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And Elisha said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 30">l</a>As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 But now bring me a <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 31">m</a>minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 32">n</a>the hand of the LORD came upon him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And he said, Thus saith the LORD, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 33">o</a>Make this valley full of ditches.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And it came to pass in the morning, when <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 34">p</a>the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 35">q</a>Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 3:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Kings 3:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 Then <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 36">r</a>he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 37">s</a>and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4" class="chapters" >Chapter 4</div>
<div id="2 Kings 4:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 38">a</a>the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 39">b</a>to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Then he said, Go, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 40">c</a>borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 41">d</a>Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And he said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 42">e</a>About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 43">f</a>do not lie unto thine handmaid.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 So she went and came unto the man of God <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 44">g</a>to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 45">h</a>did I not say, Do not deceive me?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 Then he said to Gehazi, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 46">i</a>Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 47">j</a>salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 48">k</a>lay my staff upon the face of the child.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 And the mother of the child said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 49">l</a>As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 50">m</a>not awaked.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 He <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 51">n</a>went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 52">o</a>and prayed unto the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:34" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;34 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 53">p</a>he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 54">q</a>and stretched himself upon him: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 55">r</a>the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:36" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;36 And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:37" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;37 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 56">s</a>took up her son, and went out.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:38" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;38 And Elisha came again to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 57">t</a>Gilgal: and there was a <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 58">u</a>dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 59">v</a>sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:39" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;39 And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:40" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;40 So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 60">w</a>death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:41" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;41 But he said, Then bring meal. And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 61">x</a>he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:42" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;42 And there came a man from <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 62">y</a>Baal-shalisha, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 63">z</a>and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:43" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;43 And his servitor said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 64">a</a>What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 65">b</a>They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 4:44" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;44 So he set it before them, and they did eat, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 66">c</a>and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5" class="chapters" >Chapter 5</div>
<div id="2 Kings 5:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 67">a</a>Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 68">b</a>a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 69">c</a>took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 70">d</a>God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 71">e</a>wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 72">f</a>his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 73">g</a>he was clean.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 74">h</a>no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 75">i</a>a blessing of thy servant.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 But he said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 76">j</a>As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 77">k</a>I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 78">l</a>he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 5:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 The leprosy therefore of Naaman <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 79">m</a>shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 80">n</a>a leper as white as snow.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6" class="chapters" >Chapter 6</div>
<div id="2 Kings 6:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 81">a</a>the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 82">b</a>he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 83">c</a>Dothan.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And he answered, Fear not: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 84">d</a>they that be with us are more than they that be with them.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 85">e</a>horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 86">f</a>he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 87">g</a>set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 88">h</a>the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 So <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 89">i</a>we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 90">j</a>rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 Then he said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 91">k</a>God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 But Elisha sat in his house, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 92">l</a>the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 93">m</a>See ye how this son of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 94">n</a>a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 6:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 95">o</a>what should I wait for the LORD any longer?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 7" class="chapters" >Chapter 7</div>
<div id="2 Kings 7:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 96">a</a>To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.  </div></br>

And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 7:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And there were four leprous men <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 99">d</a>at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 7:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 7:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 7:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 100">e</a>to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 101">f</a>the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 7:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Wherefore they <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 102">g</a>arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 7:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 7:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 7:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 7:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Kings 7:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 7:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 7:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste.

<div id="2 Kings 7:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians.

<div id="2 Kings 7:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 104">i</a>as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 7:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 105">j</a>Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 7:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be?

<div id="2 Kings 8:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 8:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 8:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And the king talked with <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 108">c</a>Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.  </div></br>

<div id="2 Kings 8:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 8:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 113">h</a>he shall surely die.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 8:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 114">i</a>wept.  </div></br>
<div id="2 Kings 8:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord?

<div id="2 Kings 8:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And Hazael said, But what, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=2 Kings 117">l</a>is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?
