<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>J</b></font>ust like some of David's men
debated whether or not to
share the spoil they got from battle
with the soldiers who didn't go with
them to the battle, some in the
Church have the same arguements
today. David's men reasoned thus:
&quot;It's not fair that those who went to
war and did all the fighting should
share the spoils equally with those
who stayed behind!&quot; But
David, being a man of
the Spirit, said both the
soldiers who went to war
and those who stayed
behind should share the
spoil equally.
The soldier s who
stayed behind can be
likened to the Christians
praying and interceding
for souls to be won. They
can also be likened to
those who give financially
to the spread of the
gospel around the world,
as well as those who
prepare the venue for
church services, programmes
and other special meetings-
those doing all the work, running
around behind the scenes. Thus
when the victory is won, they rejoice
too because it's as much their victory
as it's the victory of the preacher s ,
missionaries, pastors and ministers,
who went to the crusade field-&quot;the
battlefront&quot; as it were.
You may not be the preacher<em><strong> </strong></em>on the pulpit or the one
writing the best-selling
books and holding the
large evangelical crusades,
but remain faithful!
<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;Then said David,
Ye shall not do so, my
brethren, with that
which the LORD hath
given us, who hath
preserved us, and
delivered the company
that came against us
into our hand. For
who will hearken unto
you in this matter?
but as his part is that
goeth down to the
battle, so shall his
part be that tarrieth
by the stuff: they shall
part alike&quot;
(1 Samuel 30:23-24).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
Keep doing what God
  tells you to do where you
  are right now, and He'll
  reward your faithfulness
  by making you an equal
  partaker of the spoils.
  Keep supporting those
  in the frontlines every
  way you can-with your
  prayers, finances, time
  and resources-and the
  Lord will remember you
for good.</p>
