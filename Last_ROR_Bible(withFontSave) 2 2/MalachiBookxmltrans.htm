<div id="Malachi 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And I hated Esau, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 3">c</a>laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.  </div></br>
<div id="Malachi 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.  </div></br>
<div id="Malachi 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 4">d</a>The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.  </div></br>

<div id="Malachi 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 20">t</a>The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.  </div></br>
<div id="Malachi 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 21">u</a>should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Malachi 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 But cursed be <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 22">v</a>the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 23">w</a>I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.  </div></br>

<div id="Malachi 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 25">b</a>take you away with it.  </div></br>
<div id="Malachi 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.  </div></br>
<div id="Malachi 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 26">c</a>My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 27">d</a>for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.  </div></br>
<div id="Malachi 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 28">e</a>The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 29">f</a>turn many away from iniquity.  </div></br>
<div id="Malachi 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 30">g</a>For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 31">h</a>for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.  </div></br>
<div id="Malachi 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 32">i</a>have caused many to stumble at the law; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 33">j</a>ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.  </div></br>
<div id="Malachi 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Therefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 34">k</a>have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.  </div></br>

<div id="Malachi 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 37">n</a>and hath married the daughter of a strange god.  </div></br>
<div id="Malachi 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 38">o</a>and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts.  </div></br>
<div id="Malachi 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your hand.  </div></br>
<div id="Malachi 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 39">p</a>the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 40">q</a>yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.  </div></br>
<div id="Malachi 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 41">r</a>did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 42">s</a>a godly seed.

<div id="Malachi 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Malachi 43">t</a>the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.  </div></br>
