<p class="articles"><font size="+3">A</font>s a child of God, patience is
one quality that is inherent in
your recreated human spirit. It's the
ability to be unswerving or undeterred
from your deliberate purpose and
faith, even by the greatest of trials. I
like to term it &quot;staying power&quot; or
&quot;stickability.&quot; This is akin to the Greek
word &quot;hupomone,&quot; which means
patience or endurance. It's the ability
to stick with something to the very
end, despite staggering oppositions;
the ability to hold on to what you
believe despite the pressure that the
devil, your circumstances or even
your mind may be piling against
you.
Some people give up
at the slightest sign of
trouble, but if you're born
again, you have to learn
to stick and endure situations
that try your faith.
The good news is God
has deposited this quality
in you. In 2 Timothy 2:3,
we're asked to endure
hardness as good soldiers
of Christ. If it wasn't in
you to endure, God would be remiss
to ask you to do so. You have to
learn to keep keeping on, despite
the trials you face.
Some people fail in life because
they give up too soon; they haven't
learnt to stick with a situation or
process until they win. The challenges
you face are the stepping-stones to
your promotion; they can't destroy
you. Therefore, don't pack-up or
give up when challenges show up in
your life. God has given you the
strength and courage to endure
every contrary situation. You might
be facing some &quot;heat&quot; at work, school,
or in your home, but remember this:




 
you have the ability to
face any challenge and
win.
<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;Knowing this,
that the trying of
your faith worketh
patience&quot; (James 1:3).</strong></em><br>
<br>
Learn to put the
patience and staying
power that's in you to
work. Let your endurance
be mixed with hope so
you can create a better
future right in the midst
of the storm.</p>
