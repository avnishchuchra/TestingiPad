<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>J</b></font>acob battled with life; his life
was a struggle for everything he
ever wanted. He wanted his brother's
birthright, so he plotted to achieve
his desire and created unrest for
years. He wanted his choice wife and
struggled for fourteen years to
achieve his dream. Returning to Israel
was a struggle; since he could not
predict his brother's reaction, he sent
his family first ahead of
him. Jacob was a man
who had struggles of
unrest with his deceitful
life of the past. But when
he had an encounter
with God, his name was
changed to Israel and his
life became strengthened
with purpose. When Jacob
started trusting God, his
life began a process of
success.
You might have
feelings of uncertainty
about your future, about
tomorrow. Sometimes
you might struggle with
uncertainties of the present,
but Psalm 16:6 says the lines
are fallen unto you in pleasant
places, and you have a goodly
heritage. In Christ, you can only get
better; the process may be slow, but
it will only get better.
Your life will start taking shape
when you go through the process of
surrendering your works and
concerns to God. He is your perfect


<em>  </em>organizer.<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;The Lord is the
portion of mine
inheritance and of my
cup: thou maintainest
my lot. The lines
are fallen unto me
in pleasant places;
yea I have a goodly
heritage&quot; (Psalm 16:5-6). </strong></em><br>
<br> 
Daniel faced
  a lot of oppositions and
  he went through a wilderness
  life experience,
  but because he had his
  God, he recognized one
  factor, that those who
  know their God shall be
  strong and do exploits
  (Daniel 11:32). So whatever
  you think about
  yourself today, recognize
  that the lines are
  fallen unto you in
  pleasant places, and
  you have a goodly
heritage in Christ.</p>
