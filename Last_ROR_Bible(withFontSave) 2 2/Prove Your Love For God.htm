   <p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>G</b></font>od made the world and
   made man, whom He named
   Adam, to live in it. God gave Adam
   dominion over everything, except
   one-the tree of the knowledge of
   good and evil. Contrary to what
   many think, this tree wasn't there to
   tempt Adam; it was God's way of
   receiving love from him.
   The Bible lets us know that God
   loves man very much.
   But love does not only
   give, it also has the capacity
   to receive: it may not
   make a demand but it
   opens up to receive. And
   when love is stopped
   from receiving, it may be
   quenched.
   God gave everything
   to man but demanded
   from him not to eat of
   the tree of the knowledge
   of good and evil, but man
   couldn't keep his end of
   the bargain. Before then,
   man didn't have to suffer
   to eat bread because
   
   God had already put everything he
   needed in the garden. But after his
   disobedience, God said, <em>&quot;In the
   sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
   bread&quot; (Genesis 3:19). </em>When Adam and Eve ate that
   forbidden fruit, God looked beyond
   the breaking of His commandment
   and saw a lack of love in their
   action. If they had kept God's
   
   
   commandment it would
   have been enough proof
   of their love, but they
   didn't.
   <br>
   <br>
   &quot;<em><strong>And the LORD God
   took the man, and put
   him into the garden of
   Eden to dress it and to
   keep it. And the LORD
   God commanded the
   man, saying, Of every
   tree of the garden
   thou mayest freely
   eat: But of the tree of
   the knowledge of good
   and evil, thou shalt
   not eat of it: for in the
   day that thou eatest
   thereof thou shalt
   surely die&quot; (Genesis 2:15-17).</strong></em><br>
   <br>   
   The proof of your
   love for God is keeping
   His Word. God has
   given you everything
   you'll ever need, the only
   thing He asks of you is
   to reciprocate His love
   by keeping His Word.
   But His love can be
   quenched if you don't
   hearken to His instructions.
   And love brings
   forth judgment when it
   is quenched.</p>
