<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>UNLEASH YOUR FAITH</b></font></p>
 
<p class="articles"><font size="+3">I</font> love to define the&quot; fight of faith&quot;
as &quot;the unleashing of your faith
on the rebellious circumstances of
life, to compel changes to correspond
with your stubborn faith proclamations.&quot;
I chose to use the word
&quot;unleash&quot; to communicate the strength
of the definition. To &quot;unleash&quot; means
to &quot;release or vent&quot;; it means to &quot;turn
loose or free from restraint&quot;; &quot;to
release from a leash&quot; much in the
same way a guard dog is released
from its leash to pursue a criminal.
So the way and manner to apply
your faith to the contrary situations
you face isn't passive or mild; you
unleash it, and that connotes some
form of spiritual aggression!
The fight of faith is
when you vent or turn
your faith loose to run
rampage against the
negative situations of life!
When sickness attacks
your body, for example,
you unleash your faith to
the maximum! That's the
time to maintain your
confessions of healing and health,
irrespective of the symptoms you
may be feeling. That's the time to
tell that tumour, &quot;You're dead from
your roots in the Name of Jesus!&quot;
If it's poverty that tries to attack
you, do the same thing-unleash
your faith without restraints! Refuse
to accept thoughts of lack. Keep
declaring, &quot;The Lord is my shepherd,
therefore I'll never lack! He supplies
all my need according to His riches
in glory by Christ Jesus.&quot; Learn to
vocalize your faith, irrespective and
independent of obvious contrary
circumstances.
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Fight the good
fight of faith, lay hold
on eternal life...&quot; (1 Timothy 6:12).</em></strong><br>
<br>
No matter how rebellious the<em><strong> </strong></em>circumstances are, they
can never withstand the
unleashing of your stubborn
faith! This is why you
must study and meditate
on the Word of God
consciously.</p>
