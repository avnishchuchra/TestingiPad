<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>SERVE GOD WITH A LOYAL HEART</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>D</b></font>avid was a teenage shepherd
boy whose physical appearance
showed no special features.
There was nothing physically striking
about him that pointed to him as
God's choice of a king-elect. But God
sees far beyond what man can
comprehend (1 Samuel 16:7). Though
his actions weren't always perfect,
David's heart was perfect toward
God (Acts 13:22). He served God
with a loyal heart.
To be loyal means to be faithful
or steadfast in allegiance. It means to
be devoted to God's cause. This was
the virtue Saul lacked that made God
reject him as king over Israel. Another
king, Amaziah, did all the
right things but still didn't
get God's approval because
of his wrong attitude
(2 Chronicles 25:2).
So in your relation-ship
with the Lord, the s tat e
of your hear t counts!
Your attitude to God
and to service in His
Kingdom must reflect
wholehearted devotion
and unfeigned loyalty.
It's time to examine yourself and
ensure your words match your
actions, and that your actions match
the thoughts of your heart in your
service to the Lord. Who are you?
How do you do your work for the
Lord? These are very important
questions you must answer for
yourself. Only the works we do with
a sincere and loyal heart will be
accepted when we stand before the
Judgment seat of Christ; the rest will
be burnt because they have no
significance before God (1 Corinthians
3:13).

  <br>
  <strong><em>&quot;... the LORD seeth
not as man seeth;
for man looketh
on the outward
appearance, but the
LORD looketh on
the heart&quot;
(1 Samuel 16:7).<br>
  </em></strong><br>
  There are Christians who haven't<em><strong> </strong></em>pledged their allegiance
to Christ but have lived
only for themselves. But
praise God, the Church is
rising in glory and God is
purging her of all these.
So, honestly examine
yourself in the light of
God's Word today, and
pray to God to help you
make changes where
necessary.</p>
