<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>here're folks who for the first
few months, even years after
they were born again were on fire for
the Lord! They were in every prayer
meeting; always available for evangelism,
and the first to volunteer for a
new project; they prophesied in
every meeting because they were so
aglow in the Spirit.
However, as time went on, some
of such folks began to wane in zeal;
their enthusiasm for the things of the
Spirit began to dissipate. The hitherto
spiritual shine and excitement they
once manifested gradually declined!
They've become too familiar with
God. Now, they consider the fervent
zeal of younger believers
in their midst as &quot;youthful
exuberance.&quot; How sad!
Never allow the fire of
God in your spirit wane
or dissipate. You have the
responsibility to maintain
your zeal for God to a
boiling point-be aglow
in the Spirit.
Whether you've been
born again for two months
or twenty years, you ought to
maintain your zeal for the Lord; have
that child-like attitude in following
the Master. Give His Word first
place in your life, and have high
regard for spiritual things.
So if before now, it looked as
though that spiritual excitement you
once knew when you first believed
had gradually ebbed away, then it's
time to remind yourself of those
things that once stirred your spirit!
Get back to speaking in tongues and
winning souls; get back to loving
God's Word and studying it voraciously.
There's always something
fresh and new in God, and if you<em><strong> </strong></em>keep your spirit aglow
doing the Lord's work,
there'll be no dull moment
in your life. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Not slothful in
business; fervent in
spirit; serving the
Lord&quot; (Romans 12:11).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
Your life will
be full of the anointing
and power of the Holy
Ghost, and you'll only
know the upward and
forward life.</p>
