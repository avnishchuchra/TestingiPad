<div id="Esther 1" class="chapters" >Chapter 1</div>
<div id="Esther 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now it came to pass in the days of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 1">a</a>Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 2">b</a>from India even unto Ethiopia, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 3">c</a>over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 4">d</a>sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 5">e</a>Shushan the palace,  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 In the third year of his reign, he <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 6">f</a>made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 7">g</a>the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 On the seventh day, when <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 8">h</a>the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 9">i</a>Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Then the king said to the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 10">j</a>wise men, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 11">k</a>which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 12">l</a>seven princes of Persia and Media, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 13">m</a>which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 14">n</a>despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 15">o</a>give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 1:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 16">p</a>into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 17">q</a>bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Esther 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 18">a</a>what was decreed against her.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 19">b</a>Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 20">c</a>his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 21">d</a>gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 22">e</a>things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 23">f</a>Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Now when the turn of Esther, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 24">g</a>the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Then the king <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 25">h</a>made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 26">i</a>in the king's gate.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 27">j</a>Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And the thing was known to Mordecai, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 28">k</a>who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 2:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 29">l</a>the book of the chronicles before the king.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 3" class="chapters" >Chapter 3</div>
<div id="Esther 3:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 30">a</a>Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And all the king's servants, that were <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 31">b</a>in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 32">c</a>bowed not, nor did him reverence.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 33">d</a>king's commandment?  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 3:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And when Haman saw that Mordecai <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 34">e</a>bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 35">f</a>full of wrath.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 3:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 36">g</a>sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 3:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 37">h</a>they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 3:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 38">i</a>their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 3:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And the king <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 39">j</a>took <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 40">k</a>his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 3:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 3:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 41">l</a>Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 42">m</a>according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 43">n</a>in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 3:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And the letters were <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 44">o</a>sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 45">p</a>in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 46">q</a>to take the spoil of them for a prey.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 3:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 47">r</a>The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 3:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 48">s</a>the city Shushan was perplexed.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4" class="chapters" >Chapter 4</div>
<div id="Esther 4:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 49">a</a>rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 50">b</a>with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 51">c</a>cried with a loud and a bitter cry;  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 52">d</a>the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Also he gave him <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 53">e</a>the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 54">f</a>inner court, who is not called, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 55">g</a>there is one law of his to put him to death, except such <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 56">h</a>to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 57">i</a>three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 58">j</a>and if I perish, I perish.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 4:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.  </div></br>

<div id="Esther 5" class="chapters" >Chapter 5</div>
<div id="Esther 5:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now it came to pass <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 59">a</a>on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 60">b</a>the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 5:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 61">c</a>she obtained favour in his sight: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 62">d</a>the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 5:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 63">e</a>it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 5:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 5:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 5:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 64">f</a>And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 65">g</a>What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 5:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 5:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 5:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 66">h</a>that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 5:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Nevertheless Haman <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 67">i</a>refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 5:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 68">j</a>the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 69">k</a>advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 5:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 5:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 5:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 70">l</a>gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 71">m</a>speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 72">n</a>the gallows to be made.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 6" class="chapters" >Chapter 6</div>
<div id="Esther 6:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 73">a</a>the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 6:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 6:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 6:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 74">b</a>into the outward court of the king's house, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 75">c</a>to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 6:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 6:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 6:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 6:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 76">d</a>the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 6:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 77">e</a>and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 6:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 6:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 6:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 78">f</a>hasted to his house mourning, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 79">g</a>and having his head covered.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 6:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 6:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 80">h</a>the banquet that Esther had prepared.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 7" class="chapters" >Chapter 7</div>
<div id="Esther 7:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 7:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And the king said again unto Esther on the second day <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 81">a</a>at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 7:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 7:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 For we are <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 82">b</a>sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 7:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 7:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 7:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 7:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 83">c</a>the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 84">d</a>covered Haman's face.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 7:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 85">e</a>Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 86">f</a>the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 7:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 So <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 87">g</a>they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 8" class="chapters" >Chapter 8</div>
<div id="Esther 8:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 88">a</a>what he was unto her.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 8:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And the king took off <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 89">b</a>his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 8:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 8:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Then <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 90">c</a>the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 8:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces:  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 8:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 For how can I endure to see <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 91">d</a>the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 8:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 92">e</a>I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 8:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 93">f</a>may no man reverse.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 8:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 94">g</a>Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 95">h</a>from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 96">i</a>according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 8:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 97">j</a>And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 8:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 98">k</a>to take the spoil of them for a prey,  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 8:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 99">l</a>Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.  </div></br>

<div id="Esther 8:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 101">n</a>the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 8:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 The Jews had <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 102">o</a>light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 8:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 103">p</a>and a good day.

<div id="Esther 9:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 112">g</a>waxed greater and greater.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 9:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.  </div></br>
<div id="Esther 9:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.  </div></br>

<div id="Esther 9:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 123">r</a>a day of gladness and feasting, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 124">s</a>and a good day, and of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Esther 125">t</a>sending portions one to another.  </div></br>
