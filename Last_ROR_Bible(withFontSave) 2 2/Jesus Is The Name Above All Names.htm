<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>"JESUS" IS THE NAME<br> 
ABOVE ALL NAMES</b></font></p>
<p class="articles"><font size="+3">P</font>hilippians 2:9-10 is a sovereign
declaration of Deity: At the
mention of the Name of Jesus, every
knee is compelled to bow. The Name
of Jesus has power over all things,
and over all beings; whether they be
in heaven, on earth, or in hell.
Kenneth Hagin (of blessed memory)
tells a story of how as a young boy,
he died and went to hell. When he
got to the gates of hell, a
beastly-looking creature
took a hold of him to lead
him into hell. Suddenly,
he said, he heard a voice
from far above him. He
didn't understand what
the voice said, but he
recalled that when the
voice spoke, all of hell
shook and the being let
him go. He didn't know
who it was that spoke
then, but he found out it
was none other than the
Lord Jesus.
Jesus has power and
authority over everything
that exists. That's why
Peter could say to a man who was
impotent in his feet and had never
walked from birth: <em>&quot;In the name of
Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and
walk&quot; (Acts 3:6)</em>, and the man leaped
and walked. The Name of Jesus is
higher than the name of any sickness!
As long as that sickness has a name,
be it HIV, cancer, pneumonia, tuberculosis-
whatever it is, it's subject to<em><strong> </strong></em>the Name of Jesus.
Learn to call the Name
of Jesus with confidence
and with revelation; live
in that Name, for it's the
Name vested with all
power. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Wherefore God
also hath highly
exalted him, and
given him a name
which is above every
name: That at the
name of Jesus every
knee should bow,
of things in heaven,
and things in earth,
and things under the
earth&quot;
(Philippians 2:9-10). </em></strong><br>
<br>
It's higher, greater
and more powerful than
any other name that
exists. There's power in
that Name. It's the Name
above every name.</p>
