<p class="articles"><font size="+2">I</font>n your life, you must learn never
  to give thought and undue
  consideration to the devil, his little
  demons and the activities of wicked
  and unreasonable men that seek to
  bring you down. They don't count at
  all! I want you to understand
  something about who you are and
  your life as a new creation: you are
  the fulfillment of Scripture. Your daily
  life is the fulfillment of that which has
  already been written concerning
  you. That's the understanding with
  which the psalmist came to his
  conclusion in Psalm 27:1-2.
  He declared, &quot;the Lord is my
  light and my salvation; whom shall I
  fear?&quot; In other words,
  He's my deliverer; He's
  powerful enough to take
  care of me, therefore
  who dares to stand
  against me? He's actually
  asking, &quot;Where is the
  devil now?&quot; &quot;Who's so
  powerful to declare himself
  my enemy? Come out against
  me and God will be against you!&quot;
  Hallelujah!
  Then He said, &quot;When the wicked,
  even mine enemies and my foes,
  came upon me to eat up my flesh,
  they stumbled and fell&quot;. What's He
  saying? You know Jesus said prophetically
  concerning Himself, &quot;In
  the volume of the Book it is written
  of me, I come to do thy will O God&quot;
  (Hebrews 10:7). Which means when
  Jesus came, He stepped into the
  prophecy and began to live His life
  in it. In the same way, anybody that
  declares himself your enemy or
  anything that poses itself as your<em><strong> </strong></em>enemy will surely fulfill
  the Scripture of stumbling
  and falling. <br>
  <br>
  <em><strong>&quot;The LORD is
    my light and my
    salvation; whom shall
    I fear? the LORD is
    the strength of my
    life; of whom shall I
    be afraid? When<u> the
      wicked, even mine
      enemies and my foes,
      came upon me to
      eat up my flesh, they
      stumbled and fell&quot;</u> (Psalm 27:1-2).</strong></em><br>
      <br>  
      That
  means, you don't ever
  have to bother about
  your adversaries; their
  end is assured.
  Don't allow yourself
  to be distracted. Focus
  on what you've been
  called to do.</p>
