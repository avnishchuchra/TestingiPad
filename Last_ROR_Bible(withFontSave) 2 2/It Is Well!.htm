<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>"IT IS WELL!"</b></font>
<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>2</b></font> Kings 4:8-37 narrates the
inspiring story of a Shunammite
woman.Whenever the Prophet
Elisha went to Shunem, he stayed in
her house. However, this woman
and her husband didn't have any
child. When Elisha discovered this,
he told her to expect a son, and in
due course, she had a child.
Trouble struck few years later
when the child died, but the woman
knew what to do. She quickly dashed
off to the Prophet Elisha with only
one declaration on her lips, &quot;It is
well.&quot; Though there was a problem,
she kept affirming that all was well.
She had an expectation, and she held
on to that expectation
even when it seemed
impossible; she kept on
declaring it until she got
it (2 Corinthians 4:8-9).
Just as this woman
did, you have to look at
your situation through
the eyes of your spirit. 1
Corinthians 15:57-58 says,
  <em>&quot;...thanks be to God, which
giveth us the victory
through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be
ye stedfast, unmovable...&quot;</em> Another
translation says, <em>&quot;stand firm, let
nothing move you&quot; </em>(NIV). God has
given you the victory, so stand firm
and be unmovable. Don't allow your
thoughts and senses rule you, let
God's Word and His Spirit direct
you.
When trouble comes, God's will
is for something good to come out of
it. In such times, you must remember
He is with you. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Run now, I pray
thee, to meet her, and
say unto her, Is it well
with thee? is it well
with thy husband? is
it well with the child?
And she answered, It
is well&quot;
(2 Kings 4:26 ).</em></strong><br>
<br>
If He delivered you
in the past, He will do it again. Call
those times of deliverance to
remembrance and express your<em><strong> </strong></em>gratitude to God for
them. That's how to trust
God and hold on to Him
with joy even in adversity.
What problem are you
facing today? Put God's
Word first; declare what
He says about that
situation; be steadfast
and unmovable in Him
and declare with joy that
all is well!</p>
