<b>PASTOR ANITA</b>

<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>A NEW MOVE</b></font></p>

 <p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>here's a new dimension of
ministration going on in the
realm of the spirit. It's a new day and
people are coming into a deeper
knowledge of God. And do you
know what's going to happen? The
former rain and the latter rain will be
combined together in this last-day
outpouring of the Spirit. Hallelujah!
People in the world are going to
experience such spiritual
darkness as they have
never seen before, and
so the gospel is needed
now more than ever. I
tell you, if you have ever
preached the gospel,
now is the time. Double
your efforts, preach it
now more than ever. Let
your zeal for the things
of our Kingdom soar
high. If they've ever
called you a fanatic in
your life, let it be at this
time. It's time to walk in
the visions of God; it's
time to do the works of
Jesus.
The world is waiting for those
that have the solution (Romans
8:19). In Science fiction they have
talked about a new class of 'super'
men. They said these men will come
from outer space. What they don't
know is that they're already down
here on earth, and they're not green
or blue or metallic, they are the
Church of Jesus Christ. The world<em><strong> </strong></em>doesn't know it yet, but
this is what they've been
waiting for. The Church
is going to receive God's
knowledge like never
before. We will exhibit
such boldness that the
world has never seen.
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Be glad then, ye
children of Zion, and
rejoice in the LORD
your God: for he hath
given you the former
rain moderately, and
he will cause to come
down for you the rain,
the former rain, and
the latter rain in the
first month&quot;
(Joel 2:23).</em></strong><br>
<br>
We will see even our
little children preaching
the gospel with boldness.
There is a change in the
realm of the Spirit. Don't
wait; don't let it pass you
by. Step right into the
flow!
