<div id="Judges 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 1">a</a>asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And the LORD said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 2">b</a>Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 3">c</a>I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 4">d</a>Bezek ten thousand men.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 5">e</a>as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 6">f</a>the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.  </div></br>

<div id="Judges 12:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 369">b</a>put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 12:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 370">c</a>are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 12:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And the Gileadites took the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 371">d</a>passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite?

<div id="Judges 14:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 407">l</a>Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 408">m</a>lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 14:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 409">n</a>Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me.

<div id="Judges 14:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 14:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion?

<div id="Judges 14:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 410">o</a>the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle.

<div id="Judges 14:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 But Samson's wife <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 411">p</a>was given to his companion, whom he had used as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 412">q</a>his friend.  </div></br>

<div id="Judges 15:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 413">a</a>hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this?

<div id="Judges 15:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 415">c</a>in Lehi.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 416">d</a>rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines.

<div id="Judges 15:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee.

<div id="Judges 15:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 417">e</a>the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 418">f</a>slew a thousand men therewith.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-lehi.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 419">g</a>Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 420">h</a>his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof En-hakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 15:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And he judged Israel <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 421">i</a>in the days of the Philistines twenty years.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16" class="chapters" >Chapter 16</div>
<div id="Judges 16:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 422">a</a>compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.  </div></br>

<div id="Judges 16:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.

<div id="Judges 16:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson.

<div id="Judges 16:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound.

<div id="Judges 16:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 Then the lords of the Phil-istines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And when the people saw him, they <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 429">h</a>praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And it came to pass, when their hearts were <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 430">i</a>merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport.

<div id="Judges 16:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 431">j</a>roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 432">k</a>remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines.

So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 16:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 433">l</a>buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father.

<div id="Judges 18:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 448">c</a>Zorah, and from Eshtaol, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 449">d</a>to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 450">e</a>house of Micah, they lodged there.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 18:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 18:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 451">f</a>hired me, and I am his priest.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 18:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And they said unto him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 452">g</a>Ask counsel, we pray thee, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 453">h</a>of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.  </div></br>

<div id="Judges 18:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Then the five men departed, and came to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 455">j</a>Laish, and saw the people that were therein, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 456">k</a>how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.  </div></br>

<div id="Judges 18:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 When ye go, ye shall come unto a people <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 460">o</a>secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 461">p</a>a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 18:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.  </div></br>

<div id="Judges 18:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 18:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 470">y</a>lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 471">z</a>and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 18:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.  </div></br>

<div id="Judges 18:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 18:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 18:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 18:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.  </div></br>

<div id="Judges 18:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And there was no deliverer, because it was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 474">c</a>far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 475">d</a>by Bethrehob.

<div id="Judges 18:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 476">e</a>they called the name of the city <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 477">f</a>Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 18:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Judges 478">g</a>until the day of the captivity of the land.  </div></br>

<div id="Judges 19:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.  </div></br>
<div id="Judges 19:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.  </div></br>
