<b>PASTOR ANITA</b>

<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>ARE YOU A MINUS <br>
OR A PLUS?</b></font></p>


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>here are two kinds of people-
minus-people and plus-people.
A minus person is the kind of person
you leave in an office only to come
back and find the chair or some other
thing broken. When you take him to
your house, he just turns everything
upside down; he breaks furniture
and your household appliances start
having faults. But a plus person treats
everything good; the house is always
clean when he's around and he never
uses bad language.
A minus person has a critical
spirit. For example, he would always
criticize the choir ministrations in
church, but a plus person wouldn't
think like that. Rather,
he'll decide to join the
choir and add fresh ideas
to what they're doing.
Always, he's thinking
about increase. He's the
kind of fellow who is
always looking out for
someone to help. He's
always doing something
new and different for
people, and the Kingdom
of God is always uppermost on his
mind. That's unlike the minus person
who's ever in a hurry and wouldn't
see the need around him.
The man that's a plus is the man
with an excellent spirit. The Bible
described Daniel as a man with an
excellent spirit (Daniel 6:3). Daniel
became a leader of leaders. When
you study his life, you'll observe that
many others plotted against him but
they failed. A man that's a plus will
always excel above his colleagues,
and he would certainly have critics.
But minus people are spiritually
myopic!
If you're a Christian then you're


a plus in your home and
in your office; you're a
plus wherever you go.

  <strong> <em>&quot;Then this Daniel
was preferred above
the presidents and
princes, because
an excellent spirit
was in him; and the
king thought to set
him over the whole
realm&quot; (Daniel 6:3)</em></strong>.<br>
<br>  
Why? Because God has
increased you and you're
not working with your
ability, you're working
with His ability. Therefore,
men will see you
excel and give glory to
God (Romans 8:19).</p>
