<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>W</b></font>hen Moses sent twelve
spies into the land of
Canaan, ten of them brought back
this negative report: <em>&quot;...The land,
through which we have gone to
search it, is a land that eateth up the
inhabitants thereof...And there we
saw the giants, the sons of Anak,
which come of the giants: and we
were in our own sight as grasshoppers,
and so we were in their sight&quot; </em>(Numbers 13:32-33). In other words,
they were saying to Moses, &quot;Forget
about it; we can't take the land.&quot;
However, Caleb and Joshua had
a different view of the situation and
thus said: &quot;It is a wonderful country
ahead, and the Lord loves
us. He will bring us safely
into the land and give it
to us...do not fear the
people of the land. For
they are but bread for us
to eat!&quot; (Numbers 14:8-9).
In other words, they said,
&quot;Come on people, let's go
and eat up those guys!&quot;
They saw those giants the
same way God wants you
to see the challenges you face: they
are bread for you!
This is the kind of mentality David
had when he faced Goliath. Everyone
was terrified at the size of Goliath,
but David thought, <em>This guy is too
big a target; I just can't miss!</em> As a child of God, the challenges
you face are not supposed to discourage
or destroy you; they are actually
your stepping-stones for promotion.
No wonder James said, &quot;My brethren,
count it all joy when ye fall into divers
temptations&quot; (James 1:2). It should
be an exciting thing when a child of
God faces challenging situations, for
there ought to be only one sure

outcome: Victory.
<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;Only rebel not ye
against the LORD,
neither fear ye the
people of the land;
for they are bread for
us: their defence is
departed from them,
and the LORD is with
us: fear them not&quot; </strong></em>(Numbers 14:9).<br>
<br> 
No matter what you're
going through, don't give
up. If it's a sickness, tell
it, &quot;You cannot destroy
me; I have the life of God
in me and I destroy you
in the Name of Jesus!&quot;
Talk to that situation
today, because it's there
for your victory.</p>
