<div id="Jonah 1" class="chapters" >Chapter 1</div>
<div id="Jonah 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now the word of the LORD came unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 1">a</a>Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Arise, go to Nineveh, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 2">b</a>great city, and cry against it; for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 3">c</a>their wickedness is come up before me.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 But Jonah <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 4">d</a>rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 5">e</a>Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 6">f</a>from the presence of the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 But <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 7">g</a>the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 8">h</a>cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 9">i</a>into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 10">j</a>call upon thy God, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 11">k</a>if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 12">l</a>cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Then said they unto him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 13">m</a>Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 14">n</a>which hath made the sea and the dry land.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And he said unto them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 15">o</a>Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 16">p</a>but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 17">q</a>lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 18">r</a>hast done as it pleased thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 19">s</a>and the sea ceased from her raging.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Then the men <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 20">t</a>feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 21">u</a>Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Jonah 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And said, I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 22">a</a>cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 23">b</a>and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 24">c</a>For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 25">d</a>all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 26">e</a>Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 27">f</a>toward thy holy temple.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 The <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 28">g</a>waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 29">h</a>from corruption, O LORD my God.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 30">i</a>and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 They that observe <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 31">j</a>lying vanities forsake their own mercy.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 But I will <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 32">k</a>sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 33">l</a>Salvation is of the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 3" class="chapters" >Chapter 3</div>
<div id="Jonah 3:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 34">a</a>he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 3:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 So the people of Nineveh <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 35">b</a>believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 3:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 36">c</a>and sat in ashes.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 3:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 37">d</a>And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 3:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 38">e</a>let them turn every one from his evil way, and from <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 39">f</a>the violence that is in their hands.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 40">g</a>Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 3:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 41">h</a>And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 4" class="chapters" >Chapter 4</div>
<div id="Jonah 4:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 4:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 42">a</a>fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 43">b</a>gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 4:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 44">c</a>Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 45">d</a>it is better for me to die than to live.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 4:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 4:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 4:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 4:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 4:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 46">e</a>It is better for me to die than to live.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 4:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 4:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:  </div></br>
<div id="Jonah 4:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And should not I spare Nineveh, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 47">f</a>that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 48">g</a>that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Jonah 49">h</a>cattle?  </div></br>
