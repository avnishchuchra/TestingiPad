OF GOD'S DREAM</b></font></p>


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">W</font>hen you study the Bible,
especially the Old Testament,
you'll discover that God primarily
spoke to kings and prophets.
Oftentimes, He spoke to the prophet
who took the words to the king. At
other times, He gave the king a
dream and then sent a prophet to
interpret it. He said, <em>&quot;By me kings
reign, and princes decree justice&quot; </em>(Proverbs 8:15), but there were times
some didn't respond to His Word.
Some even invited and served foreign
gods. That's why there were false
kings and true kings, just as there
were false prophets and true
prophets.
Many years later, God
sent His Son because He
wanted to relate with the
new and real kings and
priests. He was tired of
sending the prophets to
the kings all the time. He
wanted the kings to hear
from Him fresh and direct;
He wanted to communicate
with them through their spirits.
So Jesus made us kings and priests
unto God, to reign on the earth
(Revelation 5:10).
We're living in the days when
God has fulfilled His dream. He's
sitting at rest in heaven since He has
delegated His authority to us, His
children. God has called you to reign
as a king in this life (Romans 5:17).
That's why He's refreshing you with
His Word today. Furthermore, He's
given you the best Friend that'll stick
with you forever-the Holy Spirit.
Always remember that you're His
representative, His ambassador.
Therefore, establish your throne by<em><strong> </strong></em>declaring His Word over
your life. Prophesy to
yourself and your situation.
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;And hast made us
unto our God kings
and priests: and we
shall reign on the
earth&quot; (Revelation 5:10).</em></strong><br>
<br>
Command those
&quot;dry bones&quot; in your life
to come alive again.
You're the one reigning,
for you're God's dream
fulfilled today. Hallelujah!</p>
