<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Word of God has the
ability to impact not only your
spirit and your mind but also your
physical body. God's Word reaches
right into your joints and bone
marrow! That means as you take the
Word into you, it goes first into your
mind, then into your spirit. Then, as
you continue to meditate on it, it
goes right into your physical body,
and impacts every fibre
of your being.
God's Word works in
your spirit the same way
physical food works in
your body. Just as the
food you eat is broken
down and absorbed until
it becomes part of you,
so also the Word of God
that you receive into you
goes right into your spirit
and becomes in you what
it says. The Bible says,
&quot;Meditate upon these
things; give thyself wholly
to them; that thy profiting
may appear to all&quot; (1
Timothy 4:15). What things
are you supposed to meditate on?
God's Word! It says give yourself
completely to the Word. That's
another way of saying let God's
Word dominate you.
You have a responsibility to
submit yourself to the Word of God
and allow it inundate your entire
being. Meditate on the Word to the
point that it literally oozes out of<em><strong> </strong></em>your entire being-spirit,
soul and body. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;For the word of
God is quick, and
powerful, and sharper
than any twoedged
sword, piercing
even to the dividing
asunder of soul and
spirit, and of the
joints and marrow,
and is a discerner
of the thoughts and
intents of the heart&quot;
(Hebrews 4:12 ).</em></strong><br>
<br>
Listen,
study, and meditate on
the scriptures until you
can only think the Word
way.
Be a doer and not
just a hearer of the Word.
Have definite times when
you listen to God's Word
and study the Scriptures
voraciously. Have definite
times of meditation when
you ruminate on the
Word and speak it until
it soaks deeply into you.</p>
