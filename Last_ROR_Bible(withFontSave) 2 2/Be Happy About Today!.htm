<p class="articles"><font size="+3">I</font>n Ecclesiastes 7:10 the Spirit of
God lets us know that it's
pointless wishing for the so-called
&quot;good old days.&quot; God wants you to
be happy about today; not wishing
you could go back in time and live in
the days of your forebears, because
you believe things were better back
then than they are now. The Bible
lets us know that it's not wise to
make such a comparison.
When you say things were better
five or ten years ago than they are
today, you're inadvertently making a
self-contradictory statement. If things
were truly better five or ten years
ago, that certainly ought to have
given birth to better days
today. Remember, a good
tree will only produce
good fruits. Therefore,
what you're harvesting in
your life today are the
investments of five years
ago. Whatever you did
then was programmed
to deliver to you what
your life is today.
Always remember that today's
problems didn't arise of themselves.
They're the offspring of yesterday's
choices and manipulations. This is
why you ought to ensure that every
day, you sow the right seeds for
your tomorrow. Rather than wish for
yesterday, be happy about the day
in which you're living. You're here
now, so this is your time. Be excited
about life and be hopeful about
tomorrow. Don't wish for days that
have passed because they will never
come back again.
The problems of today are not for
you to cry about; they're your opportunities to create a change
in your world. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Say not thou, What
is the cause that the
former days were
better than these? for
thou dost not enquire
wisely concerning
this&quot;
(Ecclesiastes 7:10).</em></strong><br>
<br>
Start programming
yourself now
for a better tomorrow by
using all the necessary
tools found in the Word
of God.
