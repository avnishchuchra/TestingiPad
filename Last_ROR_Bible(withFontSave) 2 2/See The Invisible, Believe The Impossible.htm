<p class="articles"><font size="+3">O</font>ur God is a loving God! He
doesn't take delight in our
misery. He is the Lord of the universe.
The Bible says that He created all
things for His own pleasure (Revelation
4:11). He desires to give you everything
you want because you're His
child. Your prosperity is hinged on
the presence of God with you, so
when you're conscious of His
presence, all your struggles will be
over.
Joseph recognized this truth and
took advantage of it (Genesis 39:2).
This young man knew all along that
he would be the ruler of nations and
all his kinfolks would bow before
him. In spite of the many
troubles that came upon
him, he still saw the
invisible and believed the
impossible. This is why
he wasn't bitter with
those who ill-treated him;
he knew he was going
somewhere. Whatever it
is you desire, our God<strong><em>&quot;
is able to do exceeding abundantly
above all that we ask or think,
according to the power that worketh
in us&quot; (Ephesians 3:20).</em></strong> Did you see
that? The power isn't coming from
above; it's inside you now! The Lord
Jesus wouldn't try to negotiate you
out of your desire (Matthew 21:22).
Remember that God told Abraham
that He gave him as far as his eyes
could see (Genesis 13:14-15). If you
can see it, you shall have it.
He'll not only help you get a
good job in that company, He can
make you own it. Sounds incredible,
doesn't it? But it's the truth
nonetheless! Joseph was a forgotten

LORD, the God of
all flesh: is there any
thing too hard for
me?&quot; (Jeremiah 32:27).</em></strong>

prisoner one night, the
next morning he was the
Prime Minister of the
Egyptian empire, next
only to the Pharaoh.
Our God can still do the
same today, and much
more too!
