<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>YOU HAVE THE MIND <br>
OF CHRIST!</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+3">W</font>hen you were born again,
you became a new creation
and a partaker of God's divine nature.
That immediately made it possible for
you to know the mind of God and
have access to His thoughts. That's
because as Christians, we have the
mind of Christ. The realities of God's
Kingdom are no longer a mystery to
us since we've been brought into
God's class of being; we can now
function and reason like Him.
Let the Word of Christ dwell in
you richly (Colossians 3:16). As you
learn God's Word and store it in your
heart, it influences your thoughts!
You become conditioned to thinking
God's thoughts. To some
folks, God is a mysterious
and unpredictable personality,
whose ways are
past finding out. Such
folks love to quote the
words of the prophet
Isaiah: <em>&quot;For my thoughts are not your
thoughts, neither are your ways my
ways, saith the LORD. For as the
heavens are higher than the earth, so
are my ways higher than your ways,
and my thoughts than your thoughts&quot; </em>(Isaiah 55:8-9).
This scripture addressed the Old
Testament folks that weren't born
again. Today, in the New Testament,
the Bible declares that we have the
mind of Christ; that means His ways
have become our ways, and His
thoughts have become our thoughts.
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;For who hath
known the mind of
the Lord, that he may
instruct him? But
we have the mind of
Christ&quot; (1 Corinthians 2:16).</em></strong><br>
<br>
Get acquainted with the Lord
through His Word; the more you
know Him, the more His nature and<em><strong> </strong></em>thoughts are revealed to
you, and you'll understand
His ways.</p>
