STIR UP THE FIRE CONTINUALLY!</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>T</b></font>he instruction given to the
priest under the Law of Moses
was to keep the fire burning upon
the altar in the temple. In the New
Testament, however, the altar of God
is the human heart; this is where the
presence of God resides. Thus, this
instruction was written for our benefit
as well.
The fire was ignited on the altar of
your heart the moment
you were filled with the
Holy Spirit. That's the
sanctifying fire that makes
you more than a man,
stirring up divine energy
and ability from inside
you. He empowers your
words and puts life in the
gospel you preach. This
fire must also burn on the
altar of your soul perpetually,
for you can't face
your world and win without
the Holy Spirit.
The Bible says that
Lot's righteous soul was
vexed and the fire of his
soul had started to wane
as he continued to observe the
lawlessness and ungodly ways of
the people of the cities of Sodom
and Gomorrah (2 Peter 2:6-8). In the
same manner, the movies you
watch, the books, the newspapers
and the magazines you read could
reduce the anointing upon your life,
and wear you out spiritually. This is
what the devil seeks to achieve<em><strong> </strong></em>today; he's out there
bombarding the minds
of people with ungodly
information through the
media.
<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;And the fire upon
the altar shall be
burning in it; it shall
not be put out: and
the priest shall burn
wood on it every
morning, and lay
the burnt offering in
order upon it; and he
shall burn thereon
the fat of the peace
offerings. The fire
shall ever be burning
upon the altar; it shall
never go out&quot;
(Leviticus 6:12-13).</strong></em><br>
<br>
Therefore, continually
stir up and rekindle the
embers of the inner fire
that is in you (2 Timothy
1:6). That inner fire must
be fanned continually for
its tendency is to burn
out because fire burns
to quench. Get yourself
re-charged in the Holy
Spirit everyday and stir
up the fire of the Spirit
within you by praying in
the Holy Spirit and living
in the Word.</p>
