<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>A PACKAGE OF DIVINE POWER!</b></font></p>
 

<p class= "articles"><font size="+3">W</font>hen you're born again,
your spirit becomes infused
with the presence and power of God.
You become a divine package of
power. As a Christian, never think
you're an ordinary person; you're
peculiar! You're superior to satan,
poverty, failure sickness, disease,
infirmities and death. You're not the
&quot;poor, old, weakling&quot; some around
you may think you are. You're an
embodiment of divine power, a
bundle of success, and an epithet of
prosperity. It's impossible for anything
to put you down in life. You've been
anointed with the Holy Ghost and
with power to tame the adversary.
The Bible says<em> &quot;ye
shall receive power, after
that the Holy Ghost is
come upon you&quot;</em> (Acts
1:8). You've been endued
with supernatural power.
You can change any negative
situation. You can
completely shut the devil
up, and permanently stop
his maneuvers and manipulations in
your life and in the lives of your
loved ones. No devil, sickness or
disease can stay in your body; the
power of God in you will burn them
up. Get to know who you are; you're
a supernatural being!
Never be afraid of anything. The
Bible says &quot;NOTHING shall by any
means hurt you,&quot; absolutely nothing!
(Luke 10:19)! Why? Because you're
a divine package of power!
Remember Jesus; when the
Roman soldiers came to arrest Him,
He asked them &quot;Whom do you seek?&quot;
They said &quot;Jesus of Nazareth.&quot; All He
said was, &quot;I am he&quot; and the power of<strong><em> </em></strong>God hit them and they
all went backwards and
fell to the ground (John
18:4-6). <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;But truly I am full
of power by the spirit
of the LORD, and
of judgment, and of
might...&quot;
(Micah 3:8).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
You too are
loaded with as much
power. That power is
s ickness -destroying,
demon-chasing, failureproof
and poverty-resistant.</p>
