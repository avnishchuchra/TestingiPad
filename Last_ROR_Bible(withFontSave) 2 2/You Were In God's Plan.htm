<b>PASTOR CHRIS</b>
<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>YOU WERE IN GOD'S PLAN</b></font></p>


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">F</font>rom Jeremiah chapter one
verse 5, it's obvious God knew
you ever before you were conceived
by your mother. This means you're
not an accident in this world. You're
not God's experiment, in other
words, He didn't send you here to
the world to find out what you'll do
or become. You were part of His
plan right from the foundation of the
world.
The Bible says, <em>&quot;Lo, children are an
heritage of the Lord...&quot;</em> (Psalm 127:3).
That means you're not your parents'
idea. God was the One who gave you
to your parents. When they decided
to have a child they didn't know it
was you that will come.
But God knew it was you
ever before you were conceived
in your mother's
womb.
Your parents may not
have planned for your
coming; they may have
even told you that you're
a mistake. But to God,
you're not a mistake; you
were in His plan right
from the foundation of the world.
You came because you have a
special role to play in your world.
Now to some measure, your parents
are responsible for what happens to
you. Your parent's responsibility is
to some measure because as you
grow up you become responsible
for whatever you become in life.
Maybe no one reckons with you
because you're the lastborn amongst
so many children. Remember David,
who was &quot;the runt of the litter&quot; but
became God's-chosen king of Israel.
You may look frail and fragile and
nobody thinks highly about what
you'll become in life. Remember<em><strong> </strong></em>(Jeremiah 1:5).


  
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Before I formed
thee in the belly I
knew thee; and before
thou camest forth
out of the womb I
sanctified thee, and
I ordained thee a
prophet unto the
nations&quot; </em></strong><br>
<br>
Gideon, who was the
least of the weakest tribe
in Israel but was mightily
used by God to liberate
Israel from bondage. So
you see, you're not a
mistake at all; you were in
God's plan. As you walk
with the Lord every day,
He'll reveal to you all the
things He has planned
for you.
