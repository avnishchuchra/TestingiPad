<b>PASTOR CHRIS</b>

<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>GOD KNOWS HOW TO<br> TAKE CARE OF YOU!</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>G</b></font>od knows everything. He
knows you and everything
about you. He knows the things you
need, and He knows how to get
them across to you. He is that big!
He proved this in the scriptures when
a certain Hebrew woman needed
His help. She had given birth to a son
at a time the Pharaoh of Egypt issued
an edict that every Hebrew male child
from two years down be killed. She
tried for a while to protect the child,
but it became increasingly difficult,
so she put him in a basket and allowed
him drift in the river.
At that time, Pharaoh's daughter
came to the river to have her bath
when she saw a basket
floating among the reeds.
She called for it and saw a
baby lying in it. Instantly,
she fell in love with the
baby and chose to take
care of him. She requested
for a nurse to look after
her newfound baby, and
guess what? Unbeknownst
to her, the woman
they found to take care
of the baby was the baby's own
mother! That baby was Moses. Pharaoh's
daughter paid Moses' mother
a salary to take care of her own baby.
It didn't just happen by chance; God
orchestrated everything.
Understand that God has charted
the direction of your life's journey
from start to finish. Remember, He
said, <em>&quot;I am the First and the Last&quot;</em> (Revelation 1:11), meaning He's big
enough to handle everything that
concerns you. He's mighty enough
to start you out successfully and
ensure you gloriously complete your
journey of success.
Seek to please the Lord by doing God Knows How To




His will, for that's all He
requires from you, and
He'll lead you in the path
of His righteousness, greatness
and abundance.

<em> <strong>&quot;The Lord is my
shepherd; I shall not
want. He maketh me
to lie down in green
pastures: he leadeth
me beside the still
waters&quot; (Psalm 23:1-2).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
He's your good Shepherd,
hence' trust Him with
your life and He will make
you dwell in prosperity,
peace and safety; He
knows how to take care
of His own.</p>
