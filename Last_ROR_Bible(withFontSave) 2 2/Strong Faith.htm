<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he circumstances of life that
you face may not always
correspond with what the Word of
God says or the visions God has
given you. For example, someone
may have prayed that God would
give him a particular job in a certain
organization, and may even receive
a prophecy from the Spirit of God
that the job is his. Then, based on
that Word from the Spirit,
he marches confidently
to the organization, only
to be told that the job
had been taken. At such
times, the thing to do is
not to ask, &quot;Oh God,
why?&quot; That's not the time
to lament and pour out
your frustrations; rather,
it's the time to demonstrate
strong faith.
Strong faith is unyielding
in the face of negative
situations. Strong faith
doesn't stagger. It maintains
the confession in
the face of staggering
oppositions. Strong faith
is stubborn faith. It's like the account
in the Bible where Jesus was told
that his friend Lazarus was sick. Jesus
assured them that Lazarus wasn't
going to die, but the man died! He
was dead and buried for four days
before Jesus showed up.
Now, I want you to learn from
the attitude of the Master. When He
got to the tomb of Lazarus, He didn't<em><strong> </strong></em>complain (John 11:41).
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot; And being not
weak in faith, he
considered not his
own body now dead,
when he was about
an hundred years
old, neither yet the
deadness of Sara's
womb: He staggered
not at the promise of
God through unbelief;
but was strong in
faith, giving glory to
God&quot;
(Romans 4:19-20).</em></strong><br>
<br>
As far as He was concerned,
the Father heard
Him when He said
Lazarus&quot; sickness wasn't
unto death (John 11:4).
That the man had been
buried for four days didn't
make any difference to
Jesus; His confession
wasn't going to change.
He called Lazarus out
just as you would call
someone sleeping in the
next room; that's strong
faith!</p>
