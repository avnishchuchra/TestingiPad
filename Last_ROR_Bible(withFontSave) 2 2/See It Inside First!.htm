<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>W</b></font>hen God told Abraham to
lift up his eyes and look,
He wasn't referring to his physical
eyes, but to the eyes of his spirit. He
wanted Abraham to look into the
realm of the spirit and see the realities
of His Kingdom. That's the realm
where seemingly impossible situations
in this earthly realm become possible.
However, the only way to see into
this realm is through prayer
and study of the Word.
The Word of God is
  <em>&quot;Light&quot; </em>(1 John 1:7); when
you start walking in the
light of God's Word, the
realm of the spirit will
come alive to you, and
you'll start functioning
from that realm, just like
your heavenly Father. I
remember the story of a
certain woman and her
six year-old daughter, who
both had polio and were
brought to a healing
meeting with a certain
minister. After a session
of prayers for the sick,
the six year-old girl got healed
immediately, but her mother wasn't
and wished she had been healed
like her daughter.
About four years later, after
listening to some tapes by the same
minister on healing, she got healed!
How? As she listened to the Word
of God, she was able to see into the
realm of the spirit and saw that<em><strong> </strong></em>there was no sickness
or disease in her body!
<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;And the LORD
said unto Abram, after
that Lot was separated
from him, Lift up now
thine eyes, and look
from the place where
thou art northward,
and southward,
and eastward, and
westward: For all the
land which thou seest,
to thee will I give it,
and to thy seed for
ever&quot;
(Genesis 13:14-15).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
Soon as she got a hold
of that picture, nothing
could stop her healing
from manifesting in the
physical. That's living
from inside out!
You can live free of
sickness, poverty, failure,
and suffering if you'd
only turn the light of
God's Word on your life.
That way, you'll see the
real you, and the realities
of the glorious, prosperous
and successful
life God has called you
to.</p>
