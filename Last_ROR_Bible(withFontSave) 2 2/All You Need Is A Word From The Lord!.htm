FROM THE LORD!</b></font></p>


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Bible clearly reveals to us
the potency and efficacy of
God's Word. His Word is absolute
reality, and all you need to experience
victory and promotion in life is to
take God's Word as the final authority
and only truth to live by. One Word
from the Lord is all you need to move
from one level of glory to another.
The Bible lets us know that when
the Roman centurion, whose servant
was at the point of death, heard that
Jesus was on His way to heal his
servant, he sent word to the Master
saying, &quot;You don't need to come
here Lord! Just say the Word and my
servant will be healed.&quot; Responding
to the centurion's faith,
the Master uttered a word
and the centurion's servant
was healed instantly.
On another occasion,
a woman came and
pleaded with Jesus to
heal her daughter who
was tormented by a devil
(Mark 7:25). The Master
said to her, <em>&quot;...go thy way; the devil is
gone out of thy daughter&quot; </em>(Mark
7:29). He spoke in present perfect
tense: &quot;the demon is gone out of thy
daughter!&quot; This was all the woman
needed to hear, and she knew her
daughter had been healed. The
woman and the Roman centurion
had one thing in common: faith in
the Word of the Master!
This should be your attitude as
well. Take the Word of God as the
final authority in your life. If the
Word of God says you're holy, then
you're holy! From that point on live,
talk and act as the holy, for that's
God's Word of truth concerning you.<em><strong> <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;...Lord, trouble
not thyself: for I am
not worthy that thou
shouldest enter under
my roof: Wherefore
neither thought I
myself worthy to come
unto thee: but say in a
word, and my servant
shall be healed&quot;
(Luke 7:6-7)</em></strong>.<br>
<br>
</strong></em>
  
If the Word of God says
you're healed, believe it
and keep declaring your
health, irrespective of
the symptoms you may
be feeling. All you need
is a Word from God to
put you over in life!</p>
