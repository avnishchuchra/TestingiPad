"MOST HOLY FAITH"!</b></font></p>
<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>here are two striking points to
note in Jude 1:20. The first is
the phrase &quot;building up yourselves,&quot;
which is translated from the Greek
word &quot;epoikodomeo.&quot; It's an expression
suggestive of the building of a
superstructure. It doesn't refer to
building in terms of constructing from
scratch. Rather, it means building a
structure on an already existing
foundation.
The Bible lets us know that God
has dealt to every man the measure
of faith (Romans 12:3); it's now up to
you to grow that faith and build a
superstructure on it. In essence, the
faith given to you by God is the
foundation you need to
build a life of success,
prosperity, victory and
divine health.
The second point from
Jude 1:20 I want you to
note is the term &quot;most
holy faith.&quot; This refers to
your &quot;highest level of faith.&quot; Faith is
experienced at different levels. Sometimes,
while under the influence of
God's Word, your faith can be
stirred strong, and at such moments
you're inspired to take supernatural
steps; you're energized to speak
God's Word with power and do
exploits. Such high moments and
soaring levels of faith is what the
Bible refers to as your &quot;most holy
faith.&quot;
Your &quot;most holy faith&quot; is the
highest level your faith has attained
at any given time, and the Lord is
saying to you, &quot;build up a superstructure
on that highest level of<em><strong> </strong></em>faith.&quot; <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;But ye, beloved,
building up yourselves
on your most holy
faith, praying in the
Holy Ghost&quot; (Jude 1:20).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
Never let your
faith fluctuate; let that
highest level become
your benchmark and new
lowest level! According
to the Scriptures, the way
to do this is by praying in
the Holy Ghost.</p>
