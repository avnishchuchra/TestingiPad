<p class="articles"><font size="+3">B</font>itterness and malice are
offshoots of unforgivingness.
If you want the beauty of God to
be seen in your life, then refuse to
keep malice or be bitter. Malice and
bitterness will take the shine out of
your life.
I love the counsel given by the
Spirit of God through the Apostle
Paul in 1 Corinthians 14:20; he said,
&quot;Brethren, be not children
in understanding: howbeit
in malice be ye children,
but in understanding
be men.&quot; Babies don't
know how to be bitter or
keep malice. They're too
innocent for that; they
don't have enough sense
to regard or recognize
any wrong done to them.
That's what the Spirit of
God is telling you here;
be as babies! Don't
regard the wrong done
to you by others to the
extent that you become
bitter.
One of the most dangerous
effects of harbouring bitterness or
malice in your heart is that it shortcircuits
the power of God in your
life, making you unable to function
with the Spirit. When the Kings of
Israel, Judah and Edom came to
inquire of the Lord from Elisha, he
was so angry and bitter against the
King of Israel that he couldn't hear<em><strong> </strong></em>the Spirit. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Let all bitterness,
and wrath, and anger,
and clamour, and
evil speaking, be put
away from you, with
all malice. And be ye
kind one to another,
tenderhearted,
forgiving one another,
even as God for
Christ's sake hath
forgiven you&quot;
(Ephesians 4:31-32).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
He then had
to call for a minstrel (a
musician) to play so the
anointing could come
on him.
Don't open the door
to satan in your life
through bitterness and
malice; put them away
completely. If you've
held anything against
anyone, it's time to
sincerely forgive them
and show them the love
of the Father.</p>
