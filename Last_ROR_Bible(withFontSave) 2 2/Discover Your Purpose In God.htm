IN GOD</b></font></p>
<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Apostle Paul was one of
the greatest apostles that ever
lived. He was God's apostle to the
Gentiles and he wrote most of the
books in the New Testament. But
according to the scriptures, he wasn't
always that way. As a young man, he
went about persecuting the Church
until he had an encounter with God
that transformed his life. Even
while he persecuted the
Church, God had a purpose
for him which he
didn't discover till he met
with Christ.
God alone knows
how many young people
have become terrible
criminals, not knowing
that the Lord has chosen
them to be world-class
marvels and champions.
In fact, others have died
without discovering God's
purpose for their lives.
How sad!
Don't let anyone deceive you
into believing that you're of no use
to society or to God. God doesn't
waste resources, and you can be
sure He didn't waste His resources
when He created you. He created
you for His purpose and the good
news is you can find out what your
purpose in God is. This begins first
and foremost with being born<em><strong> </strong></em>again-accepting Jesus
as the Lord of your life.
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;But in a great
house there are
not only vessels of
gold and of silver,
but also of wood
and of earth; and
some to honour, and
some to dishonour.
If a man therefore
purge himself from
these, he shall be a
vessel unto honour,
sanctified, and meet
for the master's use,
and prepared unto
every good work&quot; (2 Timothy 2:20-21).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
That's when your life in
God actually begins.
Next, you have to study
the Word and fellowship
with the Holy Spirit in
prayer. As you function
in the church, you'll
discover your specific
purpose in Him and
how exactly He wants
you to live.
That way, life would
be more meaningful to
you and you'd be able
to help others discover
their purpose in God.</p>
