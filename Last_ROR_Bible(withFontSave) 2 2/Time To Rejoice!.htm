<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Word of God leaves us in
no doubt as to the way we
ought to live as Christians. We ought
to live a happy and joyous life always.
You ought to 'rejoice' 'in the Lord, no
matter what happens around you. I
want you to notice the double
emphasis on the word &quot;rejoice&quot; in
Philippians 4:4. It lets us know that
it's your season to rejoice! It's the set
time for your joy to be full.
You might want to ask, &quot;What if
the circumstances of my life aren't
such that should give room for
rejoicing?&quot; Well, rejoice all the same!
Refuse to allow the circumstances of
life dictate your joy. You have to
understand that your
happy spirit dictates what
goes on around you. I'm
talking about being joyful
in the Spirit-the kind of joy
that transcends physical
circumstances and emotions.
When your faith is
challenged, that's the time
to rejoice.
The Bible says that
with joy you shall draw
water from the wells of salvation
(Isaiah 12:3). Salvation is an allencompassing
word; it refers to
soundness, preservation, divine health,
success, prosperity and every blessing
that the death, burial and resurrection
of Jesus Christ made available for
the Christian. In other words, God
wants you to know that you must
keep your joy afloat in order to
experience the wonderful blessings
of salvation.
Learn to maintain a joyful spirit
even in the midst of daunting and
trying circumstances, for the joy of
the Lord is your strength (Nehemiah8:10). <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Rejoice in the Lord
alway: and again I
say, Rejoice&quot;
(Philippians 4:4).</em></strong><br>
<br>
Rejoicing in the face ofadversity demonstrates
that your faith is strong
and you're living in the
finished works of Christ.
Understand that sin,
sickness, poverty, failure
and the devil have all
been defeated; so nothing
can successfully stand
against you!</p>
