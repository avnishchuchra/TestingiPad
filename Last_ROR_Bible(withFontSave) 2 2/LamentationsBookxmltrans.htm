<div id="Lamentations 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 1">a</a>how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 2">b</a>princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 She <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 3">c</a>weepeth sore in the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 4">d</a>night, and her tears are on her cheeks: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 5">e</a>among all her lovers <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 6">f</a>she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 7">g</a>Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 8">h</a>she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Her adversaries <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 9">i</a>are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 10">j</a>for the multitude of her transgressions: her <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 11">k</a>children are gone into captivity before the enemy.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 12">l</a>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 13">m</a>they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Her filthiness is in her skirts; she <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 14">n</a>remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 15">o</a>she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 16">p</a>all her pleasant things: for she hath seen that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 17">q</a>the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 18">r</a>they should not enter into thy congregation.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 All her people sigh, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 19">s</a>they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 20">t</a>if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 21">u</a>spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 22">v</a>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 23">w</a>the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 For these things I weep; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 24">x</a>mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 25">y</a>the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 26">z</a>Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 27">a</a>there is none to comfort her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 The LORD is <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 28">b</a>righteous; for I have <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 29">c</a>rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 I called for my lovers, but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 30">d</a>they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 31">e</a>while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 32">f</a>bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 33">g</a>abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 They have heard that I sigh: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 34">h</a>there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 35">i</a>the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 1:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 36">j</a>Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 37">k</a>my heart is faint.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Lamentations 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 38">a</a>and cast down from heaven unto the earth <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 39">b</a>the beauty of Israel, and remembered not <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 40">c</a>his footstool in the day of his anger!  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 41">d</a>and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 42">e</a>he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 43">f</a>he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 44">g</a>and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 45">h</a>He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 46">i</a>all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 47">j</a>The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 48">k</a>he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And he hath violently <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 49">l</a>taken away his tabernacle, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 50">m</a>as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 51">n</a>the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 52">o</a>they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.  </div></br>
<div id="Lamentations 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Lamentations 53">p</a>he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.  </div></br>
