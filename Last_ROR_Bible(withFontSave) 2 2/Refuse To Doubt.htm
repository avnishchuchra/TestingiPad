<p class="articles"><font size="+3">O</font>ne night, the disciples of
Jesus were in a boat, far out
at sea. Suddenly they saw someone
walking towards them on the water.
Terrified, they thought it was a ghost,
but it turned out to be the Master
Himself. Simon Peter, dared to say
&quot;Lord, if it's you, ask me to come to
  you on the water.&quot; Interestingly,
  Jesus didn't say, &quot;No! Walking on
  water requires lots of
  prayerfulness. Rather, He
  spoke one word to Peter
  and said, &quot;Come!&quot; Peter
  jumped out of the boat
  and began walking on
  the water to Jesus.
  But something happened
  next that changed
  the course of the story.
  Peter looked at the raging
  winds, became afraid and
  immediately began to sink.
  Why did the water, which
  up until that time held
  him up, suddenly give
  way beneath his feet? It
  was doubt that deactivated
  the power of the
  word &quot;Come&quot; which Jesus had
  spoken to him.
  If Peter had not doubted, the
  water would have held him up as
  perfectly as it held up Jesus. Never
  allow doubt to creep into your heart.
  Doubt breeds fear, and fear is of the
  devil. Build absolute confidence in
  the Word of God, for it never fails.
  All that Peter and the other disciples<em><strong> </strong></em>needed was that Word
  &quot;Come,&quot; spoken by the
  Master, and they all
  could have walked and
  danced on the sea that
  night.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong><em>&quot;...And when Peter
  was come down out
  of the ship, he walked
  on the water, to go
  to Jesus. But when
  he saw the wind
  boisterous, he was
  afraid; and beginning
  to sink, he cried,
  saying, Lord, save
  me. And immediately
  Jesus stretched forth
  his hand, and caught
  him, and said unto
  him, O thou of little
  faith, wherefore didst
  thou doubt..?&quot; (Matthew 14:29-31)</em></strong>.<br>
  <br>  
  Learn to keep your
  attention fully on what
  the Word of God says,
  and you'll never be
  overwhelmed by the
  circumstances of life.
  God's Word is trustworthy
  and dependable,
  so believe it with all
  your heart and refuse to
doubt.</p>
