<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>HIS BANNER OF LOVE IS OVER YOU</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+4" class="articles">G</font><span class="articles">od doesn't just love His
people, He is in love with
His people. A banner was a very
colorful material used by ancient
armies and waved above them as
they marched. Banners are used
today to display information. Our
God waved His resplendent banner
of love and assurance over us when
He placed our Lord Jesus Christ on
the cross. That was the eternal
symbol of His total, absolute victory
over the devil and of His Lordship
over us. On top of this precise victory,
it's inscribed in the heart of every
believer. We are recognized by our
identification with the blood of Jesus
Christ. The banner of our
God over us is love.
God's love for us is not
based on emotions or
self-gratification, but sacrifice
and commitment.
In other words, God
is committed to ensuring
we do not lack any good
thing. You are guided and
protected by God's great
love. The Bible says in Ephesians
2:4-7, <em>&quot;But God, who is rich in mercy,
for his great love wherewith he loved
us, even when we were dead in sins,
hath quickened us together with
Christ...</em> And hath raised us up
together, and made us sit together in
heavenly places in Christ Jesus: that
in the ages to come he might shew
the exceeding riches of his grace in
his kindness toward us through Christ
Jesus.&quot;
Love, which is God's banner
over you, is an eternal banner that
doesn't keep account of your faults.
It doesn't condemn you but permits
you to live by His grace. The love of God is not just for a
while, it's not there only
when you're doing well
and pleasing God. <br>
<br>
<strong> <em>&quot;He brought me to
the banqueting house,
and his banner over
me was love&quot; (Songs of Solomon 2:4).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
God
still loves you even when
you've messed things up
and made mistakes; His
love is indeed an everlasting
love.
