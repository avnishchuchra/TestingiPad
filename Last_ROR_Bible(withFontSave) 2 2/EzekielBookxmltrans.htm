<div id="Ezekiel 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 1">a</a>by the river of Chebar, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 2">b</a>the heavens were opened, and I saw <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 3">c</a>visions of God.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 4">d</a>king Jehoiachin's captivity,  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 5">e</a>the hand of the LORD was there upon him.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And I looked, and, behold, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 6">f</a>a whirlwind came <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 7">g</a>out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 8">h</a>Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 9">i</a>this was their appearance; they had <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 10">j</a>the likeness of a man.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 11">k</a>like the colour of burnished brass.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 12">l</a>And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 13">m</a>Their wings were joined one to another; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 14">n</a>they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 As for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 15">o</a>the likeness of their faces, they four <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 16">p</a>had the face of a man, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 17">q</a>and the face of a lion, on the right side: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 18">r</a>and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 19">s</a>they four also had the face of an eagle.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 20">t</a>two covered their bodies.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 21">u</a>they went every one straight forward: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 22">v</a>whither the spirit was to go, they went; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 23">w</a>they turned not when they went.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 24">x</a>and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And the living creatures ran and returned <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 25">y</a>as the appearance of a flash of lightning.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 26">z</a>one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 27">a</a>The appearance of the wheels and their work was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 28">b</a>like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 When they went, they went upon their four sides: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 29">c</a>and they turned not when they went.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 30">d</a>full of eyes round about them four.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 31">e</a>when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 32">f</a>Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 33">g</a>for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 34">h</a>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 35">i</a>And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 36">j</a>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 37">k</a>like the noise of great waters, as <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 38">l</a>the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 39">m</a>And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 40">n</a>as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 41">o</a>And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 1:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 42">p</a>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 43">q</a>This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 44">r</a>I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 2" class="chapters" >Chapter 2</div>
<div id="Ezekiel 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And he said unto me, Son of man, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 45">a</a>stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 46">b</a>the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 47">c</a>they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 48">d</a>For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 49">e</a>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 50">f</a>shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And thou, son of man, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 51">g</a>be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 52">h</a>briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 53">i</a>be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 54">j</a>though they be a rebellious house.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 55">k</a>And thou shalt speak my words unto them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 56">l</a>whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 57">m</a>eat that I give thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And when I looked, behold, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 58">n</a>an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 59">o</a>a roll of a book was therein;  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3" class="chapters" >Chapter 3</div>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 60">a</a>eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.  </div></br>

<div id="Ezekiel 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 61">b</a>eat it; and it was in my mouth <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 62">c</a>as honey for sweetness.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 63">d</a>had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 64">e</a>for they will not hearken unto me: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 65">f</a>for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 66">g</a>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 67">h</a>fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 68">i</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Then the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 69">j</a>spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 So <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 70">k</a>the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 71">l</a>the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 72">m</a>I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  </div></br>

<div id="Ezekiel 3:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 75">p</a>shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 76">q</a>but thou hast delivered thy soul.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Again, When a <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 77">r</a>righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 3:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 78">s</a>And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 79">t</a>into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.  </div></br>

<div id="Ezekiel 40:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 40:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 40:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 40:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.  </div></br>

<div id="Ezekiel 40:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against door.  </div></br>

<div id="Ezekiel 40:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.  </div></br>

<div id="Ezekiel 40:43" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;43 And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 40:44" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;44 And without the inner gate were the chambers of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 1230">r</a>the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 40:45" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;45 And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 1231">s</a>the keepers of the charge of the house.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 40:46" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;46 And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 1232">t</a>the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 1233">u</a>Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 40:47" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;47 So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 40:48" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;48 And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.  </div></br>

<div id="Ezekiel 41:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 41:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 41:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 41:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 So <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 1236">a</a>he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.  </div></br>

<div id="Ezekiel 41:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 1238">c</a>there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 41:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Ezekiel 1239">d</a>a full reed of six great cubits.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 41:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.  </div></br>

<div id="Ezekiel 41:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 41:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;  </div></br>

<div id="Ezekiel 42:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.  </div></br>
<div id="Ezekiel 42:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.  </div></br>
