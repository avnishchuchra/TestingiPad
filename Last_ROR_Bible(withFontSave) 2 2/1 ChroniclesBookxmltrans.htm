<div id="1 Chronicles 21:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Then the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Chronicles 284">k</a>angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.  </div></br>

<div id="1 Chronicles 21:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Chronicles 21:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Chronicles 21:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.  </div></br>
<div id="1 Chronicles 21:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 So <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=1 Chronicles 285">l</a>David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.  </div></br>
