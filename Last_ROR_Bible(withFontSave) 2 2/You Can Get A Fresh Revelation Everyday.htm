<P align="center"><font size="+2"><b>YOU CAN GET A FRESH REVELATION<br> EVERYDAY</b></font></P>
  
<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>Y</b></font>ou can't walk with God above
the revelation that you have
of Him. The revelation you have of
God is the light in which you'll walk
with Him. This, in fact, is the distinguishing
factor amongst Christians.
When God introduced Himself to
Moses as Jehovah (Exodus 6:2-3), He
was giving him a fresh revelation of
His personality in a way that Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob never
knew. If Moses was to
fulfill his calling as Israel's
deliverer, he needed this
new revelation. When he
asked for God's name so
as to authenticate his
mission before the Hebrew
slaves, here was God's
response: &quot;Eheyeh asher
Eheyeh&quot; (Hebrew), which
literally means <em>&quot;I AM THAT
I AM'</em> (Exodus 3:14). That
was the revelation he
needed to stand before
Pharaoh and demand
Israel's release.
God revealed Himself to His
people in the Old Testament in His
names. But in the New Testament
God has revealed Himself through
His Son Jesus, the Word. Your
revelation of God will determine
everything in your life. It'll influence
your Christian walk and your
relationship with those around you.
So what you need isn't more<em><strong> </strong></em>money, or another house,
or new friends, but a
fresh revelation of the
Lord. <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot; And I appeared
unto Abraham, unto
Isaac, and unto
Jacob, by the name
of God Almighty,
but by my name
JEHOVAH was I not
known to them&quot;
(Exodus 6:3).<br>
</strong></em><br>
  There's always
  something new, fresh
  and exciting to discover
  in God every day. This is
  what makes Christianity
  exciting! Get into the
  Word today and you'll
  discover a fresh revelation
of God's personality!</p>
