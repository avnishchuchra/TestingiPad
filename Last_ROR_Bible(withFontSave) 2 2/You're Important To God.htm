<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>T</b></font>he Bible lets us know that
Boaz redeemed all that
belonged to Elimelech and his sons,
Mahlon and Chilion, because of his
love for Ruth. It was the custom in
Israel for the nearest kinsman to a
deceased Israelite to redeem his
estate, including his widow, and that
was what Boaz did. However, he
wasn't really interested in the land
and property of Elimelech
and his sons, for he was
already a wealthy man.
He knew he had to buy
up everything to get Ruth,
for he loved her and she
had become important to
him.
If a man could go this
length to redeem a
humble lady, how much
more God! The Bible
says He didn't spare His
Son but delivered Him
up for us (Romans 8:32).
He didn't decide to give
bulls, sheep and goats
for our salvation, neither
did He send the highest
ranking angel! He gave His only Son
Jesus Christ as a sacrifice for you
and me because we're important to
Him. We're as valuable to Him as
Jesus is. That's why He spared no
cost for our salvation.
This ought to let you know that
you're priceless and important to the
Father. When you're conscious of
this truth all the time, it will add<em><strong> </strong></em>springs to your steps
and put a smile on your
face-it will kindle joy in
your heart every day.
<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;And Boaz said
unto the elders, and
unto all the people,
Ye are witnesses
this day, that I have
bought all that was
Elimelech's, and all
that was Chilion's and
Mahlon's, of the hand
of Naomi. Moreover
Ruth the Moabitess,
the wife of Mahlon,
have I purchased
to be my wife, to
raise up the name
of the dead upon his
inheritance...&quot; (Ruth 4:9-10). <br>
</strong></em><br>
  Just like Esther, you
  were born for such a
  time as this; you came
  at the right time. You
  came as the answer to
  the cry of many. You're
  God's agent of salvation
  in a hurting world. When
  you have this kind of
  mentality, you'll live as a
  helper and lifter of
  others. Remember, your
  life is for the salvation of
souls!</p>
