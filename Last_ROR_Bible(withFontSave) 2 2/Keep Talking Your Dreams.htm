<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>J</b></font>oseph kept telling his brothers
his dreams though he knew
they hated him for it. Their hatred
and scornful words didn't stop him
from speaking his dreams, and
certainly couldn't stop the dreams
from coming to pass. God can give
you a dream of a great future.
Therefore, it's expedient that you
declare the dream with your mouth,
and see beyond every
human limitation.
Let me tell you something
very important:
Some people will dislike
you for talking your
dreams. The world doesn't
like to hear you talk about
your dreams of success
and greatness. They'll
make fun of your dreams
of greatness because they
can't see beyond their
noses. They can't understand that those
dreams you talk about aren't of men,
but of God. So they jeer as they
watch to see what will become of
the dreams you've been talking
about.
Nobody may enjoy hearing your
dreams but don't stop talking about
them. As you keep talking about
what God is doing in your life, you<em><strong> </strong></em>can only get greater. <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;And Joseph
dreamed a dream, and
he told it his brethren:
and they hated him
yet the more... And he
dreamed yet another
dream and told it his
brethren, and said,
Behold, the sun and
the moon and the
eleven stars made
obeisance to me&quot; (Genesis 37:5, 9).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
It's
important that you keep
your focus on the
dreams or visions God
gives you. As long as
they are of God, they
will come to pass. Those
who laugh at you will
watch you grow and
increase until your
dreams come to pass.</p>
