<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he description of our heavenly
Father is &quot;love.&quot; He is not
&quot;judgment,&quot; as many people believe.
He's a loving heavenly Father. God
testified to His love for you in
Jeremiah 31:3.
I urge you today to rest in God's
love. Quit all struggles and take
advantage of God's unfeigned and
unconditional love for you. You may
have done so many things wrong
even as a Christian, but the Lord is
saying to you today, &quot;Rest in My
love!&quot; All you need to do is repent
and say, &quot;Lord, forgive me.&quot; Once
you repent, He is quick to forgive,
because it is His nature to forgive.
The prodigal son's
father killed the best calf
to celebrate his son's
return (Luke 15:21-23), an
allegory depicting God
as an ever-forgiving and
ever-loving Father. He
rejoices when He finds
His lost child. So, if
you've been out of
fellowship with Him, it's
time to come home. He's
waiting to receive you into His
everlasting arms of love. He's not
wielding a big stick to strike you for
your wrongs for He already struck
Jesus for your sake. All He expects
from you now is that you rest in His
love!
There is a confident assurance in
us that God never looks out for our
faults. Instead, He follows us with
His tender mercies. Let nothing
separate you from God's love, not
even the sins you've committed. No
matter how grievous a man's sins
are, God will still forgive and forget;
He receives him and establishes him
in the right path.<br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;And we have
known and believed
the love that God hath
to us. God is love; and
he that dwelleth in
love dwelleth in God,
and God in him&quot;
(1 John 4:16). </em></strong><br>
<br> 
Having this kind of
confidence in God's love
comes by acquaintance
with Him. Get to know
and understand the
nature of your heavenly
Father, and you'll be
joyful at all times in His
presence.</p>
