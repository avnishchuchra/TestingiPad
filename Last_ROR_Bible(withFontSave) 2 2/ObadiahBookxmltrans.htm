<div id="Obadiah 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 1">a</a>concerning Edom; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 2">b</a>We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.  </div></br>
<div id="Obadiah 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.  </div></br>
<div id="Obadiah 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 3">c</a>of the rock, whose habitation is high; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 4">d</a>that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?  </div></br>
<div id="Obadiah 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 5">e</a>Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 6">f</a>set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Obadiah 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 If <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 7">g</a>thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 8">h</a>would they not leave some grapes?  </div></br>
<div id="Obadiah 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!  </div></br>
<div id="Obadiah 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 9">i</a>the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 10">t</a>hat <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 11">t</a>hey eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 12">j</a>there is none understanding in him.  </div></br>

<div id="Obadiah 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And thy <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 14">l</a>mighty men, O <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 15">m</a>Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.  </div></br>
<div id="Obadiah 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 For thy <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 16">n</a>violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 17">o</a>thou shalt be cut off for ever.  </div></br>
<div id="Obadiah 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 18">p</a>cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.  </div></br>
<div id="Obadiah 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 But thou shouldest not have <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 19">q</a>looked on <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 20">r</a>the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 21">s</a>rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.  </div></br>
<div id="Obadiah 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;  </div></br>
<div id="Obadiah 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.  </div></br>
<div id="Obadiah 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 22">t</a>For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Obadiah 23">u</a>as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.  </div></br>
