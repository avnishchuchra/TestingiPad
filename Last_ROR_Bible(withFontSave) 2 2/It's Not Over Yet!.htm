<b>PASTOR ANITA</b>

<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>ITS NOT OVER YET!</b></font></p>
 


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">I</font>'m often amazed at how some
Christians easily give up and
succumb to life's challenges. You've
got to understand that if you're a
child of God, you aren't a victim! The
prophet Habakkuk described a dire
situation, yet he chose to rejoice in
the Lord all the same: <em>&quot;Yet I will
rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the
God of my salvation. The LORD God
is my strength, and he will
make my feet like hinds'
feet, and he will make me
to walk upon mine high
places....&quot; </em>(Habakkuk 3:18-
19). In other words, although
there was a problem,
the prophet wasn't
moved by what he saw,
felt, or perceived.
This should be your
attitude as well. The story
isn't complete until you've
won! Things may not be
going the way you expect
at the moment, but don't
despair. Reiterate your
trust in God by giving
Him praise for doing all
things well. Tell yourself, &quot;I'm not
giving up&quot; and begin to rejoice in
the God of your salvation.
Remember Paul and Silas? Things
couldn't have looked more hopeless
for them as they huddled in chains
in the dark dungeon of that maximum security
Roman prison. But instead
of cringing in fear and hopelessness,
they decided to praise God, and you

 
know the rest of the
story (Acts 16:23-36).
It's time for you to
praise God like you've
never done before. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Although the fig
tree shall not blossom,
neither shall fruit
be in the vines; the
labour of the olive
shall fail, and the
fields shall yield
no meat; the flock
shall be cut off from
the fold, and there
shall be no herd in
the stalls: Yet I will
rejoice in the LORD,
I will joy in the God
of my salvation...&quot;
(Habakkuk 3:17-18)</em></strong>.<br>
<br> 
You
may not feel like it, but
praise Him anyway,
because that's where
the victory lies! It's not
over yet. Put your trust
in God. Worship Him in
spirit and in truth and
He'll inhabit your praise,
and bring His power to
bear on your situation.</p>
