THE BEST FOR THE LAST!</b></font></p>
 
<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Lord Jesus is exactly like
God the Father (John 10:30).
Thus, the things He did are indicative
of the Father's character. So when
He brought out the best wine at the
end rather than at the beginning or
middle of the wedding party in Cana
of Galilee, it lets us know that
sometimes the Lord could reserve
the best for last. This is instructive.
Bringing this home, the Lord
could choose to reserve the blessing
and impartation of the Spirit you're
meant to receive during a church
service or meeting till the end of that
meeting. Usually, in the House of
God, people come to receive the
Word but oftentimes,
you see two groups of
people. The one are
those who hardly wait
for the service to end
before they're gone. As
soon as they think the
preacher is done, they're
out, always in a hurry.
The second group are
those who come early
and stay right through till
the end of the service. Sometimes,
the Word that someone in the first
group needs to change his situation
just might come right at the end of
the service, or during the benediction,
but he's already gone, hence he
misses his hour of visitation.
One of the things you need to
learn when you go to church is to
wait until the service closes. It pays
to be patient! Know that the Lord
may not always do things in the way
we expect Him to. It's better to
discipline yourself to stay in the
Lord's presence and never be in a
hurry to leave, for that may just be
when your much anticipated Word


  of blessing and miracle
will come to you. <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;...Every man at
the beginning doth
set forth good wine;
and when men have
well drunk, then
that which is worse:
but thou hast kept
the good wine until
now&quot; (John 2:10).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
He is
God, and it's up to Him
how He wants to
accomplish His work.
Your part is to be patient
and be in the right place
at the right time. That
way, you'll never miss
out on God's best for
you, for He sometimes
saves the best for last.</p>
