<p class="articles"><font size="+3">I</font> believe one of the greatest
things in life is to know that
you're loved by God, the Creator of
the universe. The Bible says He cares
for you affectionately and cares
about you watchfully. This world is
full of troubles and you will face
different challenges as long as you're
living in it. But the good news is that
Jesus overcame the world for your
sake (John 16:33). Therefore, you
should no longer have sleepless
nights over any situation in your life.
Some people find it difficult to
sleep when they're confronted with
challenges. Such people are oblivious
of the fact that they were called into
a life of rest. The Bible
says, &quot;For he that is
entered into his rest, he
also hath ceased from his
own works, as God did
from his&quot; (Hebrews 4:10).
Jesus was mocked to the
cross; He was spat on,
beaten, rejected, and then
He died. All these He did
so that you may no longer cry.
Therefore, whenever you think
about the death of Jesus, always
remember that He took all those
pains, worries, and dejection which
could have caused you the sleepless
nights.
Remember that when He was
praying in the garden of Gethsemane
just before He was arrested, His
disciples were sleeping. They awoke
only after He had finished praying
and He said to them, &quot;Sleep on now,
and take your rest...&quot; (Matthew 26:45).
The Bible says, <em>&quot;For he that is entered
into his rest, he also hath ceased from
his own works, as God did from his&quot;</em><strong><em> </em></strong> (Hebrews 4:10). <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Casting all your
care upon him; for he
careth for you&quot;
(1 Peter 5:7)</em></strong>.<br>
<br> 
He has
given you rest and taken
your sleepless nights
away. 1 Peter 5:7 tells
you what to do when
you're faced with challenges.
Therefore, never
let worry or any other
thing steal your rest
away from you.</p>
