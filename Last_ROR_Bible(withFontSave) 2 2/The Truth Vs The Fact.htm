<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>THE TRUTH VS THE FACT</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>S</b></font>omeone once defined 'fact'
as a piece of information
about circumstances that exist or
events that have occurred. However,
the 'truth' is what the Word of God
says about the same circumstances
or events. The Word is truth (John
17:17); it is reality. Job 22:29 clearly
shows the difference between the
fact and the truth. It shows us that
even though it's a fact that everything
is hopeless and there's no sign that
things are going to get better, we
can still declare the truth of God
and say, &quot;We're lifted up everywhere.&quot;
Hallelujah!
It's very important that you realize
the difference between
the fact and the truth.
Otherwise, you wouldn't
know how to take yourself
out of any undesirable
situation using the principle
of confession. For example,
a man had an accident
and the x-ray showed that
his bone was broken.
When he was told, he
said, &quot;No, the bone is not
broken in Jesus' Name!&quot;
That was wrong! There's a difference
between denying the fact and
denying fact the power to determine
the circumstances of your existence.
The Bible never told us to deny
the fact of our situation; rather, it
says we should proclaim, confess or
affirm the truth of God's Word in
the situation. It was a fact that the
man's bones were broken, however,
the truth says, <em>&quot;...by whose (Jesus')
stripes ye were healed&quot; (1 Peter 2:24).</em> So, the man's declaration ought to
have been: &quot;By the stripes of Jesus
Christ I am healed.&quot; Declaration of the
truth activates the power of God<em><strong> </strong></em>causing the situation to
conform to your declaration.<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot; When men are
cast down, then thou
shalt say, There is
lifting up; and he
shall save the humble
person&quot;
(Job 22:29).</strong></em><br>
<br>
Therefore, refuse to
  be dominated by the
  facts of your situation,
  rather let the truth of God
  be your focus. Fill your
  ears, eyes and mouth
  with it, so you can effect
  any change you desire in
your life today.</p>
