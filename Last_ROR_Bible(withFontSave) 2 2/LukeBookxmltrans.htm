<div id="Luke 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Luke 11">k</a>to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.  </div></br>

<div id="Luke 1:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Luke 22">v</a>Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.  </div></br>

<div id="Luke 1:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,  </div></br>

<div id="Luke 1:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,  </div></br>

<div id="Luke 1:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Luke 27">a</a>Hail, thou that art highly favoured, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Luke 28">b</a>the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.  </div></br>

<div id="Luke 1:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.  </div></br>
<div id="Luke 1:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Luke 30">d</a>And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Luke 31">e</a>shalt call his name JESUS.  </div></br>
<div id="Luke 1:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 He shall be great, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Luke 32">f</a>and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Luke 33">g</a>the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:  </div></br>

<div id="Luke 1:34" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?  </div></br>
<div id="Luke 1:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 And the angel answered and said unto her, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Luke 35">i</a>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Luke 36">j</a>the Son of God.  </div></br>
<div id="Luke 1:36" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.  </div></br>
