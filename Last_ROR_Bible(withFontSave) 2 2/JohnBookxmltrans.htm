<div id="John 1:48" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;48 Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.  </div></br>
<div id="John 1:49" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;49 Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 56">d</a>thou art the Son of God; thou art <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 57">e</a>the King of Israel.  </div></br>

<div id="John 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 69">k</a>my Father's house an house of merchandise.  </div></br>
<div id="John 2:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 70">l</a>The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.  </div></br>

<div id="John 4:49" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;49 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.  </div></br>
<div id="John 4:50" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;50 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.  </div></br>
<div id="John 4:51" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.  </div></br>
<div id="John 4:52" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;52 Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.  </div></br>
<div id="John 4:53" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;53 So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.  </div></br>
<div id="John 4:54" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;54 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.  </div></br>

<div id="John 5:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Now there is at Jerusalem <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 144">b</a>by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.  </div></br>
<div id="John 5:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.  </div></br>
<div id="John 5:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.  </div></br>
<div id="John 5:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.  </div></br>
<div id="John 5:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?  </div></br>
<div id="John 5:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.  </div></br>
<div id="John 5:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Jesus saith unto him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 145">c</a>Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.  </div></br>
<div id="John 5:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 146">d</a>on the same day was the sabbath.  </div></br>
<div id="John 5:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 147">e</a>it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.  </div></br>
<div id="John 5:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.  </div></br>
<div id="John 5:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?  </div></br>
<div id="John 5:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.  </div></br>
<div id="John 5:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 148">f</a>sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.  </div></br>
<div id="John 5:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.  </div></br>
<div id="John 5:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.  </div></br>

<div id="John 5:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 152">j</a>The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.  </div></br>

<div id="John 9:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 355">b</a>but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 356">c</a>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.  </div></br>

<div id="John 9:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 362">i</a>How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?

<div id="John 9:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:  </div></br>

<div id="John 9:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 These words spake his parents, because <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 365">l</a>they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 366">m</a>should be put out of the synagogue.  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 367">n</a>Give God the praise: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 368">o</a>we know that this man is a sinner.  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.  </div></br>

<div id="John 9:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 374">u</a>the Son of God?  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:36" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;36 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:37" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;37 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 375">v</a>it is he that talketh with thee.  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:38" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:39" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;39 And Jesus said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 376">w</a>For judgment I am come into this world, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 377">x</a>that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:40" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;40 And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 378">y</a>and said unto him, Are we blind also?  </div></br>
<div id="John 9:41" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;41 Jesus said unto them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 379">z</a>If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.  </div></br>

<div id="John 11:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 418">a</a>Mary and her sister Martha.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 419">b</a>(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 420">c</a>but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 421">d</a>he abode two days still in the same place where he was.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 His disciples say unto him, Master, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 422">e</a>the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 423">f</a>If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.  </div></br>

<div id="John 11:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 425">h</a>sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 But I know, that even now, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 426">i</a>whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 Martha saith unto him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 427">j</a>I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 Jesus said unto her, I am <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 428">k</a>the resurrection, and the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 429">l</a>life: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 430">m</a>he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 431">n</a>I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 432">o</a>The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 433">p</a>Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:34" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 434">q</a>Jesus wept.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:36" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:37" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;37 And some of them said, Could not this man, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 435">r</a>which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:38" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;38 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:39" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;39 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:40" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 436">s</a>see the glory of God?  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:41" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:42" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 437">t</a>because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:43" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:44" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 438">u</a>his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:45" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 439">v</a>and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:46" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.  </div></br>

<div id="John 11:48" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.  </div></br>
<div id="John 11:49" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;49 And one of them, named <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 442">y</a>Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,  </div></br>

<div id="John 11:51" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;51 And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;  </div></br>

<div id="John 11:53" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;53 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.  </div></br>

<div id="John 11:57" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.  </div></br>

<div id="John 12:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 453">d</a>had the bag, and bare what was put therein.  </div></br>
<div id="John 12:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.  </div></br>

<div id="John 21:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.  </div></br>
<div id="John 21:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 780">a</a>Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 781">b</a>the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.  </div></br>
<div id="John 21:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.  </div></br>
<div id="John 21:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 782">c</a>knew not that it was Jesus.  </div></br>
<div id="John 21:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Then <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 783">d</a>Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.  </div></br>

They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.  </div></br>
<div id="John 21:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Therefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 785">f</a>that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord.

<div id="John 21:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.  </div></br>
<div id="John 21:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.  </div></br>
<div id="John 21:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.  </div></br>
<div id="John 21:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.  </div></br>

<div id="John 21:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.  </div></br>

<div id="John 21:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 This spake he, signifying <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 791">l</a>by what death he should glorify God.

<div id="John 21:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=John 792">m</a>whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?  </div></br>
<div id="John 21:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?  </div></br>

<div id="John 21:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?  </div></br>
