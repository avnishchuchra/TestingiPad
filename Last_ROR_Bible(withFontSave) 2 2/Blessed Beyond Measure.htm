<p><b>PASTOR ANITA</b></p> 

<P align="center"><font size="+2"><b>BLESSED BEYOND MEASURE</b></font>
<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>W</b></font>hen God blesses a man,
he remains a blessed man.
It's impossible for him to be cursed
anymore. Moreover, that blessing
can't be reversed. So a Christian has
no business trying to get rid of any
curse, because he's blessed. He was
born into God's blessing (Ephesians
1:3).
You're a new creation, a new
species that never existed before (2
Corinthians 5:17). You have no past
but a glorious future. You're the
reflection of God's beauty. The
situation in your life that simulates the
influence of a curse is not a curse at
all but a mentality or a mindset. So
you see, ignorance is the
reason for your predicaments
and challenges
(Hosea 4:6). To change
your mentality isn't a
difficult task. All you need
is to focus your attention
on the Word of God. It'll
wash your mind of the
wrong information and
give you a new mentality
(Romans 12:2).
Some ministers pride themselves
on being able to detect and remove
curses. Such 'spiritual detectives' are
only out to deceive because there
are no valid scriptural parameters
for detecting whether or not a man
is under the influence of curses. If
you listen to such people, you'll
soon lose the beauty of what God
has done in your life.
You were translated from the
kingdom of darkness into the Kingdom
of light (Colossians 1:13). You've
been called to inherit a blessing (1
Peter 3:9). God chose and called
you into a blessing (John 15:16).
Therefore, discover the worth of the<em><strong> </strong></em>price Jesus paid for you;
think about the beauty of
God's Word; talk about
the great things God is
doing in your life. <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;...the LORD
thy God would
not hearken unto
Balaam; but the Lord
thy God turned the
curse into a blessing
unto thee, because the
Lord thy God loved
thee&quot;
(Deuteronomy 23:5).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
Stop
referring to the failures
of the past. Leave your
past behind and keep
marching on to your
glorious future in Christ
Jesus.</p>
