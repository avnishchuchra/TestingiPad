<p class="articles"><font size="+3">S</font>omeone rightly said that it's
better to light a candle than to
curse darkness. Those who haven't
known Jesus are in darkness (John
12:46). So as Christians, we shouldn't
waste time condemning the darkness-
just turn on the light and
darkness will go! That's why the Lord
Jesus told us to preach the &quot;gospel&quot;
which is 'the good news' of what His
death, burial and resurrection accomplished
for humanity.
It's not enough that you're
preaching a message about Jesus
Christ; it's got to be &quot;good news,&quot; for
if it's not &quot;good news&quot; then it's not
gospel. Some folks don't like it when
they hear us preach the
good news to sinners.
&quot;Why not preach against
sin, instead of 'watering
down' the gospel?&quot; they
query. It's obvious that
such people don't understand
the gospel of Christ.
Jesus didn't send us to
preach sin to the sinners
but the good news.
You don't have to
terrify the one you're preaching to
or condemn him about his sin; he's
a sinner and that's the only life he
knows, which is why he needs a
new life. The gospel to the sinner is
that eternal life is available to him
from God now, and that he doesn't
have to continue to wallow in sin
and guilt anymore. Your message
should gladden his heart and show
him that God loves him in spite of all
the wrongs in his life, and sent Jesus
to bear the penalty of his sins.
This is the message that turns
sinners into saints and melts even
the hardest and most callous hearts;
it's the power of God unto salvation<em><strong> </strong></em>(Romans 1:16). <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;And how shall they
preach, except they be
sent? as it is written,
How beautiful are
the feet of them that
preach the gospel
of peace, and bring
glad tidings of good
things!&quot; (Romans 10:15).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
Remember,
it's the goodness of
God that leads men to
repentance (Romans 2:4)
not the terror or judgment
of God. So the next
time you open your
mouth to preach, make
sure you preach the good
news.</p>
