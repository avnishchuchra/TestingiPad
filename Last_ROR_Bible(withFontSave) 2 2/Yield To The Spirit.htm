<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>YIELD TO THE SPIRIT</b></font></p>



<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he more yielded you are to
the Spirit of God, the greater
His works are manifested through
you. One of the most beautiful
experiences you can have is for the
Holy Spirit to take over your soul;
that is, to take over your mental and
physical faculties. When this happens,
you are literally moved by the Holy
Spirit.
When the Spirit takes over your
soul, you will say and do things that
are beyond your understanding and
your life will become truly supernatural.
Ezekiel had this experience
and he said, &quot;The Spirit entered into
me and set me upon my feet.&quot; What
an experience the man
had with the Holy Spirit!
He was aware that the
Spirit of God was moving
him thi s way and he
yielded to Him. I've learnt
to yield my faculties to
the Spirit of God. I've
had several experiences
when I knew that the words I was
speaking and the actions I was taking
were not just me anymore, but the
Spirit in action. At those times, great
miracles always take place for the
Holy Spirit is in control.
Have you ever found yourself
just crying and groaning in prayer,
unable to speak? That was the Spirit
in control! The Bible says that the
Holy Spirit prays through us with
groanings that can't be put in
articulate speech (Romans 8:26).
Whenever the Holy Spirit prompts
you to do something from within,
don't argue or struggle with it; go
ahead and take the step. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;And he said unto
me, Son of man,
stand upon thy feet,
and I will speak unto
thee. And the spirit
entered into me when
he spake unto me,
and set me upon my
feet...&quot;(Ezekiel 2:1-2).</em></strong><br>
<br>
The more<em><strong> </strong></em>obedient you are in
yielding to those gentle
tugs within, the more He
can work His purpose
out through you. You will
live a great, miraculous
life, if only the Spirit could
take over your soul.
