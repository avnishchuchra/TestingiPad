<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>T</b></font>he story of Elijah and the
widow of Zarephath in 1 Kings
17 is a touching one. The widow
gave the prophet of God all she had,
which was a ration that was just
enough to keep herself and her son
alive. The woman's faith moved Elijah
to proclaim blessings of prosperity
upon her (1 Kings 17:14). The little
she had was multiplied and she didn't
lack throughout the duration of the
famine.
If the widow and her son, had
eaten the food, they would have died.
But she was smart enough to recognize
that true prosperity comes from the
Lord. She acted her faith and gave all
she had to the man of
God and she got her
miracle.
When you study your
Bible, you would discover
that the kings and governments
of the day weren't
responsible for the prosperity
of the people.
The prophets were the
ones responsible, for
they were God's representatives.
Not much has changed
since then. Crying to political leaders
to improve the economy of the
nation wouldn't yield much result
because you're calling on the wrong
people. The power to get wealth is
not with the kings, the politicians or
the governments but the Lord
(Deuteronomy 8:18).
In 2 King 6:26, a woman cried
out to the king for help as there was
severe famine in the land. The king
responded quickly, <em>&quot;...If the LORD
do not help thee, whence shall I help
thee?&quot;</em> (2 Kings 6:27). Even the king
knew he couldn't do anything about
the devastated economy of the<em><strong> </strong></em>country without God's
help.
<br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;For thus saith
the LORD God of
Israel, The barrel of
meal shall not waste,
neither shall the cruse
of oil fail, until the
day that the Lord
sendeth rain upon the
earth&quot; ( 1 Kings 17:14 ).<br>
</strong></em><br>
  You have to realize
  that God wants you
  prosperous and He has
  sent your man of God to
  bless you. Therefore,
  when the land is dry,
  don't look up to the
  government or the politicians
  to help you, rather,
look unto God.</p>
