<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>"COME UP HITHER!</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+3">G</font>od doesn't want you to get
too comfortable with where
you are today. He wants you to move
up. Yes, He has ordained good things
to happen in your life but there is a
greater glory! Don't stay with that
which is good; strive for the best. As
you grow in the knowledge of Christ,
the Lord expects you to leave the
good things for the best. He wants
you to discover the higher realm of
glory He prepared for His children,
and there's room for everyone at this
realm of life.
For example, it's good to be healed
from sickness or disease. It's good
when someone who's broke suddenly
receives a f inancial
miracle. But that's not God's
best for His children. He
wants you to move to the
level where you're no
longer sick trying to be
healed or poor trying to
be rich. He wants you to
come to that place where
you don't know what it is
to be sick, a place where
you don't know financial
depravity. Put simply, He wants you
to come up to a higher level, to your
place of inheritance in Christ Jesus
where you prosper and all your
needs are met. It's a place of power
and authority over the devil and the
cohorts of hell. That's your place;
that's where you belong!
I urge you to come up to your
place of glory; come up to the place
meant for you. It's a place of joy,
peace, power and success. It's a
place where divinity reigns! That's
where God has called you to be;
that's where you belong. All you
need to do is say, "Yes!" and you'll
see the glory of God manifested in<em><strong> </strong></em>your life in an unusual
way. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>"And they heard
a great voice from
heaven saying unto
them, Come up
hither" (Revelations 11:12).</em></strong><br>
<br> 
The wisdom, power
and grace of God will
function in you in ways
you never thought possible.
Yield yourself to the
Word; let it gain root in
your spirit, soul and body
and you'll find yourself
catapulted unto higher
realms of glory by the
power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
