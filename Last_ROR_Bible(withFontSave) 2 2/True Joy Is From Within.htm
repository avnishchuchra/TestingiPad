<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>TRUE JOY IS FROM WITHIN</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>F</b></font>or some people, they'll have
to watch a comedy before
they can laugh when they're feeling
sad. However, the effect of this
doesn't last, for it doesn't take long
before all their troubles come rushing
back to mind as soon as they're done
with having a good laugh. Such
people always find themselves
unhappy without any reason, as they
haven't learnt how to generate joy
from within.
Comedians cannot keep you
happy permanently. They may make
you laugh for a while but after the
show is over, your situation remains
unchanged. There is, however, a joy
that comes from the inner
man. This kind of joy
transcends physical circumstances;
it's permanent
and will keep a man
s t rong and al ive. In
essence, true joy is the
product of the recreated
human spirit (Galatians
5:22). This means that if
you're born again, joy is
a part of you and God
expects you to generate it from
within your spirit. The Bible already
told you that the joy of the Lord is
your strength; that means if there's
no joy, there'll be weakness in your
life.
You don't have to wait for
anyone to make you happy; nobody
has that responsibility. However, it's
your responsibility to make others
happy, for you can generate joy
from within and spread it all
around.
The Bible says, <em>&quot;Delight thyself
also in the LORD; and he shall give
thee the desires of thine heart&quot; </em>(Psalm
37:4). Therefore, if you know how<em><strong> </strong></em>to generate joy from
inside, you'll not even
have to pray about
everything you desire;
God will take care of
them all.

<br>
<em><strong>&quot;...Go your way,
eat the fat, and drink
the sweet, and send
portions unto them
for whom nothing is
prepared: for this day
is holy unto our Lord:
neither be ye sorry; for
the joy of the LORD
is your strength&quot;
(Nehemiah 8:10).</strong></em><br>
<br>
Learn to laugh at the
devil and your troubles,
and those challenges that
seem insurmountable will
suddenly fade away. So,
go ahead and generate
joy today!</p>
