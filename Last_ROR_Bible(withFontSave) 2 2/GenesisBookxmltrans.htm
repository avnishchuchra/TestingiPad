<div id="Genesis 37:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1057">b</a>their evil report.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1058">c</a>the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1059">d</a>hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 For, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1060">e</a>behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1061">f</a>the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1062">g</a>thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1063">h</a>his brethren envied him; but his father <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1064">i</a>observed the saying.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1065">j</a>Hebron, and he came to Shechem.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And he said, I seek my brethren: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1066">k</a>tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1067">l</a>Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1068">m</a>they conspired against him to slay him.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1069">n</a>Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1070">o</a>Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1071">p</a>And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1072">q</a>Ishmeelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1073">r</a>balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:26" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1074">s</a>conceal his blood?  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1075">t</a>let not our hand be upon him; for he is <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1076">u</a>our brother and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1077">v</a>our flesh. And his brethren were content.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 Then there passed by <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1078">w</a>Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1079">x</a>and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1080">y</a>twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1081">z</a>rent his clothes.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:30" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1082">a</a>is not; and I, whither shall I go?  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:31" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;31 And they took <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1083">b</a>Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:32" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;32 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:33" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1084">c</a>evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:34" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;34 And Jacob <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1085">d</a>rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:35" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;35 And all his sons and all his daughters <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1086">e</a>rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1087">f</a>I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 37:36" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;36 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1088">g</a>the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.  </div></br>

<div id="Genesis 38:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1089">a</a>turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And Judah <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1090">b</a>saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1091">c</a>Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1092">d</a>Er.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1093">e</a>Onan.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1094">f</a>Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 And Judah <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1095">g</a>took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.  </div></br>

<div id="Genesis 38:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1098">j</a>thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1099">k</a>his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1100">l</a>him also.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1101">m</a>Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did.

<div id="Genesis 38:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1103">o</a>was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1104">p</a>to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1105">q</a>sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1106">r</a>that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.)

<div id="Genesis 38:17" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;17 And he said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1107">s</a>I will send thee a kid from the flock.

<div id="Genesis 38:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee?

<div id="Genesis 38:19" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;19 And she arose, and went away, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1110">v</a>laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:20" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:21" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:22" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:24" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1111">w</a>played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom.

<div id="Genesis 38:25" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1113">y</a>Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1114">z</a>the signet, and bracelets, and staff.  </div></br>

<div id="Genesis 38:27" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:28" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.  </div></br>
<div id="Genesis 38:29" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Genesis 1119">e</a>Pharez.  </div></br>
