  WITH YOUR LIFE!</b></font>
<p class="articles"><font size="+4"><b>W</b></font>henever most people think
about the story of Job in
the Bible, what comes to their mind
is how much he suffered and his
great patience. But there's something
else just as inspiring about the
account of Job in the Bible, and that
has to do with how the Lord bragged
about him before satan: <em>&quot;the LORD
said unto Satan, Hast thou considered
my servant Job, that there is none like
him in the earth, a perfect and an upright
man, one that feareth God, and
escheweth evil?&quot;</em> (Job 1:8)<em>.</em> The Lord
bragged about Job.
Even when Job messed things up
and opened the door for the enemy to
bring destruction into his
life, the Lord still bragged
to satan about Job's faithfulness!
And at the end,
the Lord reversed all the
evil the devil did and
made Job even more
prosperous than he was
at the beginning. I want
you to learn something
from this today-God
loves to brag with your
life! He loves to show off with you
before the angels and the people of
the world by ensuring you live a
healthy, successful and prosperous
life. He wants them to see His
greatness in your life as they behold
your prosperity and progress!
The Bible says thanks be to God,
Who in Christ always leads us in
triumph as trophies of Christ's
victory and through us spreads and
makes evident the fragrance of the
knowledge of God everywhere, for
we are the sweet fragrance of Christ
(2 Corinthians 2:14-15). Glory to
God!
We're His trophies! We're the sweet fragrance of Christ!
Your life is not for shame
and emptiness; it's for
beauty and for glory! <br>
<br>
<strong><em> &quot;And the LORD
said unto Satan, Hast
thou considered my
servant Job, that there
is none like him in the
earth, a perfect and
an upright man, one
that feareth God, and
escheweth evil&quot; (Job 1:8). </em></strong><br>
<br> 
It's
for God to mani fes t
Himself and display you
as the evidence of His
mercy and many-sided
wisdom. Walk tall for
Him today! The King of
kings loves to show off
with your life.</p>
