<b>PASTOR ANITA</b>  
<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>THE LIMITS ARE BROKEN</b></font></p>


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">W</font>hen you received the Holy
Spirit, you also received
the anointing that removes burdens
and destroys yokes. That anointing
changes everything in your life. It
guides you, leads you and destroys
every limitation, such that you're
able to face life with the giant-killer
mentality.
Your life as a Christian has been
programmed in one direction only:
upward and forward. No wonder the
Bible says <em>&quot;...the path of the just is as
the shining light, that shineth more
and more unto the perfect day&quot;</em> (Proverbs 4:18). This is the path of
your life; this is the road you've been
called to travel. Refuse the
up-and-down life; refuse
sickness, poverty, failure
and everything that's
inconsistent with the
glory-life you've been
called to live.
The Lord Jesus brought us a life
of rest, peace, and fulfillment, where
there are no limitations; you're at
liberty to excel and live a glorious,
purposeful and victorious life in
Christ. Your life has been programmed
to move from glory to glory
and from faith to faith. Your
tomorrow should be better than
today, and your next year should be
greater than this year.
Remember, you've been brought
into the glorious liberty of the sons
of God; you're at liberty to succeed!
Every hindrance in your life has been
destroyed; the limits are off. Nothing
can hold you back anymore. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;And it shall come
to pass in that day,
that his burden shall
be taken away from
off thy shoulder, and
his yoke from off thy
neck, and the yoke
shall be destroyed
because of the
anointing&quot; (Isaiah 10:27).</em></strong><br>
<br>
It's<em><strong> </strong></em>time to give a shout of
victory to the Lord, for
every wall of opposition
has been knocked down,
just as the walls of
Jericho crumbled before
the children of Israel.</p>
