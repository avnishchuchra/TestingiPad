<p class="articles"><font size="+3">L</font>ife is filled with choices that
can either make or mar you.
At different stages of life, you're
presented with different choices,
and to make such decisions without
errors, you need proper guidance
which only God's Word can
provide.
In John 1:9, the Bible says the
Word of God is the true Light. It's the
Sword of the Spirit with which you
pierce your way through the darkness
of life. If the true Light dwells richly in
you, fear, defeat, failure, and all other
result of darkness won't have any
place in you. You won't fear because
the true Light will show you that God
has not given you the
spirit of fear. You won't be
defeated because you'll
see that greater is He
that is in you than he that
is in the world. You won't
be sick because you'll
discover that by His stripes, you
were healed. The Word of God will
reveal to you what God sees you to
be.
It's your responsibility to invest
the Word of God in yourself by
studying it regularly. If you can
inundate your mind with it and store
it in your spirit, the Word of God will
produce great results in you and you
will glow with the glory of God.
You'll have a clear direction in life
and others will acknowledge that
you're different.
Do you now see how victoriously
you can live if you keep the Word of
God in your heart? If there's any<em><strong> </strong></em>darkness in your family,
academics, or business,
just take a hold of the
light of God's Word and
pierce through the
darkness in the Name
of Jesus!<br>

<em><strong>&quot;Thy word is a lamp
unto my feet, and a
light unto my path&quot;
(Psalm 119:105).</strong></em></p>
