<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>GET RID OF PRIDE</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+3">S</font>ome people have the erroneous
idea that you have to
be rich to be proud. However, the
rich and successful people aren't
always proud. In most cases, true
success and riches are the expression
of humility.
The Bible says, <em>&quot;But he giveth
more grace. Wherefore he saith, God
resisteth the proud, but giveth grace
unto the humble&quot;(James 4:6). </em>So for
the rich man to be exalted thus, it
means he must have been humble at
some point in his life. Forget about
those who may have used the wrong
means to attain some level of status
in the society. I'm talking about those
who through their hard
work or some blessing of
favour have found themselves
journeying successfully
on the ladder of
wealth or prominence.
The spiritual principle
is that a man first must
be humble to get into
the position of greatness.
Pride will impede your prosperity.
Saul, the king of Israel, started out as
a humble man. The Lord chose him
as king over His people, Israel,
because of his humility (1 Samuel
15:17). But when he became proud
and impudent a few years into his
reign in Israel, the Lord took the
kingship away from him and his
household, and gave it to David, a
lowly shepherd boy.
Humble people impress God. No
wonder the Bible says that God exalts
the humble; no wonder a timid
fisherman like Peter became a great
apostle; no wonder a harlot like Rahab
became a forebear of the Lord<em><strong> </strong></em>Jesus ; no wonder an
injurious personality like
Saul became the great
apostle Paul. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;A man's pride shall
bring him low: but
honour shall uphold
the humble in spirit&quot;
(Proverbs 29:23). </em></strong><br>
<br> 
How does
God see you? Make up
your mind to walk in
humility today.</p>
