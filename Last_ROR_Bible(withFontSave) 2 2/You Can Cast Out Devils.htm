<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>YOU CAN CAST OUT DEVILS</b></font></p>


<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Lord Jesus never said signs
shall follow only pastors,
prophets and evangelists.&quot; Rather,
He said these signs shall follow the
believing ones-those who are born
again! This means that every child of
God can cast out devils, both the
one who got born again last week
and the one who's been born again
for twenty years. You don't ever have
to be afraid of the devil or his little
demons, because the Lord Jesus has
completely and finally paralyzed
them!
The Bible records that Jesus shook
off from Himself the hostile princes
and rulers and boldly displayed them
as His conquests when
He triumphed over them
by the Cross (Colossians
2:15). Jesus' victory over
the devil was for you and
me. That's why He said,
&quot;In my Name, shall they
cast out devils.&quot; That's
another way of saying, &quot;Kick them
out in the Name of Jesus!&quot; It's not a
question of how &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;spiritual&quot;
you are; the issue is that Jesus has
given you His own authority. You
have the power of attorney to use
the Name of Jesus. Thus, when you
say &quot;Devil, get out of here in the
Name of Jesus,&quot; he's got no option
but to scamper away in terror!
The devil is no longer a factor.
You can stop him any day, any time
and anywhere if he tries to play his
games around you. <br>
<br>
<em><strong>&quot;And these signs
shall follow them that
believe; In my name
shall they cast out
devils...&quot; (Mark 16:17).</strong></em><br>
<br>
No need to
negotiate with him; cast him out!
The devil has no right to run things
in your life, or in your home, or in<em><strong> </strong></em>the lives of your loved
ones. It's time to put a
stop to his work by
exercising your authority
in Christ.</p>
