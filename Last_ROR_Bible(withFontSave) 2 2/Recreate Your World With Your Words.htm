 <p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>RECREATE YOUR WORLD<br> 
  WITH YOUR WORDS<br></b></font></p>
  
  
 <p class="articles"> <font size="+4">D</font>o you have a situation that
  you want to change? Is there
  anything you want to make or see in
  your life? You don't have to cry about
  it. You can take the Word of God
  and use it to change things or
  recreate your world for the better.
  This is the principle that God used to
  create the world.
  The Bible says, <em>&quot;Through faith we</em>  <em>understand that the worlds
  were framed by the word
  of God, so that things
  which are seen were not
  made of things which do
  appear&quot; </em>(Hebrews 11:3)<em>.</em>  The whole earth was a
  chaotic mass and full of
  darkness. The Holy Ghost
  was brooding over it,
  incubating upon it, but
  nothing changed. That
  period of incubation was
  important, because He
  was conceiving what He
  was about to create.
  Then in the midst of that
  chaos and darkness, God
  
  said, &quot;Let there be light&quot; and there
  was light! The Bible says concerning
  the Word of God that <em>&quot;All things
  were made by him; and without him
  was not any thing made that was
  made&quot;</em> (John 1:3).
  What do you want to create
  today? What situation do you want
  to change? Romans 10:8 says that
  the Word is near you and it's in your
  
  
  heart.<br>
  <br>
  <em><strong>&quot;And the earth was
  without form, and
  void; and darkness
  was upon the face
  of the deep. And the
  Spirit of God moved
  upon the face of the
  waters. And God said,
  Let there be light: and
  there was light&quot; (Genesis 1:2-3).</strong></em><br>
  <br>  
  That Word that
  created the universe
  and upholds it today is
  still here with us. Take it
  with you and lift your
  voice in prayer to God.
  When you have incubated
  upon that situation, go
  ahead and speak and
 recreate your world!</p>
