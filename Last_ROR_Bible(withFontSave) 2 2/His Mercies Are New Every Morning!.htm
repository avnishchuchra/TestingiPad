<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he Bible lets us know that the
manna with which God fed
the children of Israel in the wilderness
couldn't be eaten stale. It was always
fresh. In the same way, God's tender
mercies for us are new every morning.
He's always watching you, guiding
you and protecting you. He is
gracious towards you.
God's mercy is so strong. The Bible
says He's rich in mercy
and loves us infinitely
(Ephesians 2:4). To the
world, God is judgment,
but to us His kids, He is
love. He said in Jeremiah
31:3, <em>&quot;Yea, I have loved
thee with an everlasting
love: therefore with lovingkindness
have I drawn
thee.&quot; </em>No wonder He tells
us to approach His throne
of grace with boldness
and obtain mercy, and
find grace to help in time
of need (Hebrews 4:16).
What joy! What comfort; to
know that God is not angry with me!
Instead, He renews His love and
mercies towards me every morning!
Take advantage of the grace and
mercies of God. Don't condemn
yourself because of what you did
wrong, for He never condemns you:
  <em>&quot;There is therefore now no condemnation
to them which are in Christ<strong> </strong>Jesus...&quot;</em> (Romans 8:1).
<br>
<br>
<em><strong> &quot; It is of the
LORD'S mercies
that we are not
consumed, because
his compassions fail
not. They are new
every morning: great
is thy faithfulness&quot;
(Lamentations 3:22-
23).</strong></em><br>
<br> 
He sees the best in you
always, and expects you
to see the best in yourself
and others around you
as well.</p>
