<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>BENEFITS OF TITHING</b></font></p>

<p class="articles"><font size="+3">T</font>he tithe is one-tenth of your
increase; that is, ten percent
of your income and anything else
God blesses you with. For example,
if you receive $7,000 as your pay or
as a gift, ten percent of that amount,
which is $700, is your tithe. That
$700 belongs to God.
One of the surest ways to experience
prosperity in God's kingdom
is through tithing. It's
surer than saving money
in the bank because of
the promise attached to
it (Malachi 3:10).
Your tithe is your connection
to your source of
blessing. It doesn't matter
how much you've got
now, if you don't tithe, it's
impossible for you to
continue in prosperity.
But as long as that
connection is maintained,
there will be an unending
flow of supernatural prosperity.
If you own a business,
you should be smart
enough to connect it to your source
of blessing through your tithe. If you
don't, you'll experience a lot of
struggling and the business will
eventually fade.
God is the source of wealth, and
He wants you to connect your job
or business to Him through your
tithe. <br>
<br>
<strong><em>&quot;Bring ye all
the tithes into the
storehouse, that there
may be meat in mine
house, and prove me
now herewith, saith
the LORD of host, if I
will not open you the
windows of heaven,
and pour you out a
blessing, that there
shall not be room
enough to receive it&quot;
(Malachi 3:10).</em></strong><br>
<br>
Connect with Him from the
onset, even when your business is<em><strong> </strong></em>still small or it seems
like things aren't working
out so well. That connection
is proof things
are going to work out,
and you'll be a great
success.
When you tithe, your
job or business and your
finances are protected.
God rebukes the devourer
for your sake,
and instead of losses,
there's a blessing upon
you and you find yourself
riding higher and
higher in permanent
prosperity.</p>
