<div id="Micah 1:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 The word of the LORD that came to <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 1">a</a>Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 2">b</a>which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 1:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 Hear, all ye people; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 3">c</a>hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 4">d</a>be witness against you, the Lord from <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 5">e</a>his holy temple.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 1:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 For, behold, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 6">f</a>the LORD cometh forth out of his <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 7">g</a>place, and will come down, and tread upon the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 8">h</a>high places of the earth.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 1:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 And <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 9">i</a>the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Therefore I will make Samaria <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 10">j</a>as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 11">k</a>discover the foundations thereof.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 12">l</a>hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Therefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 13">m</a>I will wail and howl, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 14">n</a>I will go stripped and naked: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 15">o</a>I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 1:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 For her wound is incurable; for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 16">p</a>it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.  </div></br>

<div id="Micah 1:12" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;12 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 20">t</a>evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 O thou inhabitant of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 21">u</a>Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 1:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Therefore shalt thou <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 22">v</a>give presents to Moresheth-gath: the houses of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 23">w</a>Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 1:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 24">x</a>Mareshah: he shall come unto <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 25">y</a>Adullam the glory of Israel.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 1:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Make thee <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 26">z</a>bald, and poll thee for thy <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 27">a</a>delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.  </div></br>

<div id="Micah 2:1" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;1 Woe to them <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 28">a</a>that devise iniquity, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 29">b</a>work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 30">c</a>it is in the power of their hand.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 2:2" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;2 And they covet <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 31">d</a>fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 2:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 32">e</a>this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 33">f</a>for this time is evil.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 In that day shall one <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 34">g</a>take up a parable against you, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 35">h</a>lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 36">i</a>he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 2:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 37">j</a>cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 38">k</a>Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 2:9" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;9 The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 39">l</a>rest: because it is <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 40">m</a>polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 If a man <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 41">n</a>walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.  </div></br>

<div id="Micah 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 45">r</a>their king shall pass before them, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 46">s</a>and the LORD on the head of them.  </div></br>

<div id="Micah 3:3" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;3 Who also <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 48">b</a>eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 49">c</a>as flesh within the caldron.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 3:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Then <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 50">d</a>shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.  </div></br>
<div id="Micah 3:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Thus saith the LORD <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 51">e</a>concerning the prophets that make my people err, that <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 52">f</a>bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Micah 53">g</a>he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.  </div></br>
