<div id="Haggai 1:5" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;5 Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 7">g</a>Consider your ways.  </div></br>
<div id="Haggai 1:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 Ye have <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 8">h</a>sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 9">i</a>he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.  </div></br>
<div id="Haggai 1:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.  </div></br>
<div id="Haggai 1:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.  </div></br>

Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house.  </div></br>
<div id="Haggai 1:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 Therefore <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 12">l</a>the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.  </div></br>
<div id="Haggai 1:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 And I <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 13">m</a>called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 14">n</a>upon all the labour of the hands.  </div></br>

<div id="Haggai 1:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message unto the people, saying, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 16">p</a>I am with you, saith the LORD.  </div></br>

<div id="Haggai 2:4" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;4 Yet now <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 22">c</a>be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts:  </div></br>

<div id="Haggai 2:6" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;6 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 25">f</a>Yet once, it is a little while, and <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 26">g</a>I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;  </div></br>
<div id="Haggai 2:7" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;7 And I will shake all nations, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 27">h</a>and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.  </div></br>
<div id="Haggai 2:8" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;8 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.  </div></br>

<div id="Haggai 2:10" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;10 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,  </div></br>
<div id="Haggai 2:11" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;11 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 30">k</a>Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,  </div></br>

And the priests answered and said, No.  </div></br>
<div id="Haggai 2:13" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;13 Then said Haggai, If one that is <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 31">l</a>unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.  </div></br>
<div id="Haggai 2:14" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;14 Then answered Haggai, and said, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 32">m</a>So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.  </div></br>
<div id="Haggai 2:15" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;15 And now, I pray you, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 33">n</a>consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:  </div></br>
<div id="Haggai 2:16" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;16 Since those days were, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 34">o</a>when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.  </div></br>

<div id="Haggai 2:18" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;18 Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 38">s</a>the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it.  </div></br>

<div id="Haggai 2:23" class="verses" ><img src="pink_buttons.png" width="29" height="20" /> &nbsp;23 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 44">y</a>and will make thee as a signet: for <a href="myapp://app_action?selector=doTheWork:&verseID=Haggai 45">z</a>I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.  </div></br>
